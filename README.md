# ReuniceWP3

Development about a portail that help to interrogates the different open science repository of the REUNICE project partners.

You can see in [the introduction](./Introduction.ipynb) the explanation about the search via open science portals.

Regarding the WP3 package,the objective is to interrogate the REUNICE Open Science portals to find similar articles as ours.
- The idea was to interrogate directly through a program the different portals.. But it is only possible (from the information we get from the OS portals) with UC (Repositorio/Dspace) and UPHF (Hal).
- Another solution is to periodically (1/month) build a database manually with the articles created by each partner  and to interrogate itâ€¦ Its is a long and repetitive task..


do not hesitate to contact emmanuel.adam-at-uphf.fr if you have any advice...

Best regards..
