A cross-layer framework for adaptive processor-based systems regarding error resilience and power efficiency,,"This dissertation proposes a cross-layer framework able to synergistically optimize resilience and power consumption of processor-based systems. It is composed of three building blocks: SWIELD multimodal flip-flop (FF), System Operation Management Unit (SOMU) and Framework Function Library (FFL). Implementation of the building blocks is performed at circuit, architecture and software layer of the system stack respectively. The SWIELD FF can be configured to operate as a regular flip-flop or as an enhanced flip-flop for protection against timing/radiation-induced faults. It is necessary to perform replacement of selected timing-critical flip-flops in a system with SWIELD FFs during design time. When the system is active, the SWIELD FFs operation mode is dynamically managed by the SOMU controller according to the current requirements. Finally, the FFL contains a set of software procedures that greatly simplify framework utilization. By relying on the framework, a system can intelligently interchange techniques such as Adaptive Voltage/Frequency Scaling, selective Triple Modular Redundancy and clock gating during operation. Additionally, a simple and convenient strategy for integration of the framework in processor-based systems is also presented. A key feature of the proposed strategy is to determine the number of SWIELD FFs to be inserted in a system. Using this strategy, the framework was successfully embedded in instances of both single- and multicore systems. Various experiments were conducted to evaluate the framework influence on the target systems with respect to resilience and power consumption. At expense of about 1% area overhead, the framework is able to preserve performance and to reduce power consumption up to 15%, depending on the number of SWIELD FFs in the system. Furthermore, it was also shown that under certain conditions, the framework can provide failure-free system operation.",,"Veleski, Mitko",2022,10.26127/BTUOpen-6145,,OPUS4-6145,Dissertation
Five studies on recent topics in energy economics,,"In this dissertation, I present five articles regarding two relevant discussions within the field of energy economics: First, three papers discuss the German energy transition and in particular the increasing shares of renewable energies, its cost, benefits and respective challenges to its realization. Second, two papers discuss potential asymmetric pricing in the retail fuel sector in Germany, realizing an analysis with significantly improved data sets compared to earlier studies to answer more specific research questions. The first three articles focus on the reconstruction of the German energy market into a low-carbon emission setting, especially by utilizing renewable energies. First, the analysis concentrates on the developing energy policy-related goals and the energy economic status-quo, such as the functioning of the system of feed-in tariffs within the market for renewable energies and its general effects on costs. Second, the study deals more deeply and with a quantitative emphasis on the roll-out of renewable energies in Germany and especially its economic effects, such as costs and benefits for energy consumers. Results showed that until 2030, German electricity consumers will pay around &#8364;2011 200 billion for RES installations built before the end of 2011. Third, related to the public opinion on the energy transition process, the dissertation unfolded challenges and misconceptions and offers implications for an improved communication approach. The analysis showed by the use of qualitative, semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews that despite the alleged clarity of goals, about two dozen questioned German energy stakeholders have very diverse reasons for the energy transition. The results indicated that one crucial reason is climate protection while a second one is energy autarchy. However, the heterogeneity of goals and conflicting objectives can lead to social tensions and mistrust, which can be appropriately addressed with specific communication methods (e.g. infographics). The last two articles focus on econometric analyses regarding potential asymmetric pricing within the German retail fuel sector. In particular, the two papers examine the potential existence of Rockets and Feathers, i.e. higher adjustment speeds of retail fuel prices after oil price increases compared to oil price decreases. The dissertation analyzed a tremendous amount of data regarding retail diesel prices from two databases, compiled and processed by the author. The analysis proved with the help of Error Correction Models (following Engle/Granger) that e.g. specific major brands of retail fuel station as well as the local competitive environment influence the probability of Rockets and Feathers. Additionally, the analysis revealed that the nature of Rockets and Feathers is not static over time, i.e. the magnitude of the effect has dynamics across different time periods and consumer behavior can be seen as one reason for the phenomenon of asymmetric pricing.",,"Kreuz, Sebastian",2022,10.26127/BTUOpen-5863,,OPUS4-5863,Dissertation
Analysis of the relationship between spatial urban expansion and temperature utilising remote sensing and GIS techniques in the Accra and Kumasi Metropolises in Ghana,,"Accra and Kumasi are the two major cities in Ghana. Spatial urban expansion has been experienced in transforming different non-urban Land Use Land Cover (LULC) types into urban/built-up areas with a potential direct relationship to temperature rise in the cities. Thus, this dissertation aims to establish the relationship between urban spatial expansion and temperature in Accra and Kumasi metropolis. Multi-source datasets such as remote sensing images, different GIS vector layers, reference maps and historical temperature datasets were used for this retrospective study. This research was grouped under three components: environmental science, environmental technology, as well as environmental management and planning. From the environmental science component, LULC maps were produced for different years to assess the trend of temporal change in the various LULC classes in the two metropolises. Remote sensing indices and land surface temperature were retrieved from the remote sensing images to determine their correlations. Temperature time series was analysed by calculating temperature indices and determining temporal trends to reveal changes in air temperature to detect urban warming and its impacts. From the environmental technology, the novel random forest algorithm was utilised to classify the satellite images of both cities since previous works have utilised other traditional classifiers. The satellite imageries were used for point-based estimation of temperature to determine Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) hotspots. For environmental management and planning, spatial urban expansion techniques were utilised to ascertain trends in urban/built-up areas, especially in both cities' sub-metropolitan zones. For prescient purposes, future LULC modelling was implemented to provide insights into the proportions of the various LULC changes in 2025. The analysis identified two salient findings: increased urban/built-up areas at the expense of agricultural and forestlands throughout the study period and the positive correlation between spatial urban expansion and temperature. This indicated warming up of urban temperature in both cities. The major findings in this dissertation provided evidence of how integrated datasets and research techniques can be utilised for LULC changes to determine the relationship between spatial urban expansion and temperature at local scales. Institutions such as metropolitan assemblies and policymakers may adopt the concepts demonstrated in this work to rapidly assess urban environments and investigate the relationship between spatial urban expansion and temperature.",,"Frimpong, Bernard Fosu",2022,10.26127/BTUOpen-6073,,OPUS4-6073,Dissertation
Atomic layer deposition and characterization of metal oxide thin films,,"This thesis describes low temperature growth of wide band gap metal oxide thin films deposited by thermal (T-) and plasma-enhanced (PE-) atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques in which high quality materials are grown with atomic level precision. Metal oxides are extensively investigated due to their exceptional physical and chemical properties, including relatively wide band gap, high dielectric constant and high thermal stability. This variety of properties results in a wide range of different applications. Thin films of indium oxide (InOx), gallium oxide (GaOx), zinc oxide (ZnOx), and quaternary InOx/GaOx/ZnOx (IGZO), in addition to the well-known aluminum oxide (AlOx), and the catalyst cerium oxide (CeOx), have proven to be superior candidates for many applications; from microelectronics and optoelectronics to gas sensor devices. The demanding requirements of low-temperature deposition processes for thermal sensitive substrates, which include high layer homogeneity and conformality over large areas, makes ALD a pioneer deposition technique. Although many oxides have been grown by TALD and PEALD, the deposition of wide band gap oxides at low temperatures are rarely reported and/or being investigated. In this work, the deposition method of the individual binary oxide films and combining the respective binary processes into the developed super-cycle growth of quaternary compound have been investigated at relatively low-temperatures by TALD and PEALD. Besides, the growth characteristics and chemical properties of the deposited films were evaluated by in-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the influence of ALD process parameters on the growth mechanism and films composition are discussed in detail for any potential applications.",,"Mahmoodinezhad, Ali",2022,10.26127/BTUOpen-6134,,OPUS4-6134,Dissertation
Graphene synthesis under Si-CMOS compatible conditions,,"Due to the unique electronic band structure, graphene has opened the great potential to extend the functionality of a large variety of graphene-based devices in health and environment, energy storage, or various microelectronic applications, to mention a few. At this point, the implementation of graphene into Silicon (Si) semiconductor technology is strongly dependent on several key challenges. Among them, high-quality and wafer-scale graphene synthesis on CMOS compatible substrates is of the highest importance. Though large-area graphene can be achieved on substrates like copper, platinum, silicon carbide, or single-crystal Ni, however, high growth temperatures, unavailability of large scale, or contamination issues are the main drawbacks of their usage. In this PhD work, 8-inch scale graphene synthesis is attempted on alternative substrates such as epitaxial Germanium on Si and polycrystalline Nickel on Si. To achieve the growth of the highest quality of graphene, this work focuses on the investigations of various nucleation and growth mechanisms, substrate-graphene interfaces, effects of different substrate orientations, and detailed microscopic and macroscopic characterization of the grown films. Finally, it should also be stressed that the experiments in this work were carried out in a standard BiCMOS pilot-line, making this study unique, as its results might directly pave the way to further graphene integration and graphene-based device prototyping in mainstream Si technologies.",,"Akhtar, Fatima",2022,10.26127/BTUOpen-5927,,OPUS4-5927,Dissertation
Flood vulnerability assessment and adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers : a case study of the Orashi basin in the Niger Delta,,"In most studies on flood risk in Nigeria, priority is given to urban flood risk than rural flood risk. Smallholder farmers who mostly inhabit rural areas and flood plains are known to be at great risk of flooding, but to date, there have been no studies on the impacts they experience and how they cope with these impacts. To establish the existence of significant change in precipitation in the study area, statistical analysis of precipitation data was conducted using linear regression and non-parametric Mann Kendall test. Landsat satellite images for 1986, 2003 and 2016 were obtained from the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) website and used to collect and analyze data related to land use. To determine flood risk in the context of land use change, the HEC-HMS model version 3.5 was used. Land use maps corresponding to 1986, 2003, and 2016 LULC conditions were analysed and prepared for the calculation of CN values using Soil Conservation Service (SCS-CN) method. CN map was prepared by integrating the maps of hydrologic soil groups and land use in ArcGIS software. Based on selected morphological parameters, a flood risk map was developed for the study area. The morphologic flood risk showed that most parts of the basin face moderate flood risk. Higher runoff values were observed under 2016 LULC conditions mainly due to intense deforestation relative to those of 1986 and 2003. The results indicated that runoff and peak discharge are significantly affected by deforestation instead of changes in the rainfall pattern. Flood inundation maps of the study area were prepared for the flood events of 2012 and 2015. Maximum depth for the 2012 and 2015 flood events was calculated as 10.58m and 7.39m, respectively. The socioeconomic aspects of the research were conducted using household survey method. Using snowball sampling techniques, 400 flood-affected households were selected. The results show that the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers in the study area remains very low and hampered by several factors such as poverty and weakened social networks. The synopsis of the examined variables leads to the following conclusion: Instead of climatic factors - as one indicator of vulnerability - it is social inequality and poverty in the region as well as the structural economic differences between various groups that mainly drives vulnerability in the study area.",,"Mbachu, Ikechukwu",2021,,,OPUS4-5721,Dissertation
Impacts of artisanal small-scale gold mining on Hkaung Tung Hka Chaung River and recommendations for the conservation of Indawgyi Lake/Myanmar,,"Indawgyi Lake is one of the largest lakes in East Asia. Due to its habitat diversity and its great importance for international bird migration, it has the status of an UNESCO biosphere reserve. In the last decades, anthropogenic pressures on the lake due to increasing population numbers, overfishing and intensification of agriculture and forestry as well as to the impacts by artisanal small-scale gold mining in the catchment area have increased sharply. As a result of gold mining, lake inflows have very high suspended matter loads, both from the washing of gold-bearing sediments and from soil erosion as a result of the destruction of the floodplain and of the forest close to the river. The input of sediments and suspended matter from the Hkaung Tung Hka Chaung River has led to massive deposits of river sediments in the southern part of Indawgyi Lake within a few years. In the context of short-term investigations and a one-year monitoring close to the stream mouth, the extent of the suspended matter input from Hkaung Tung Hka Chaung River into Indawgyi Lake was estimated and heavy metal pollution concentrations of the suspended matter were measured as a basis for recommendations for the reduction of the pollution pressure on the lake. Sedimentation analyses showed that the river water was still very turbid even after 50 hours due to high concentrations of very small solids. In contrast, material in the size of sand grains settled completely after about ten hours. The clay fraction of the suspended matter was heavily contaminated by different heavy metals, including cadmium, copper, nickel, chromium and lead. The load of suspended matter was subject to strong fluctuations and showed no correlation with the discharge. The mean concentration of suspended matter was 9.6 g/L (as dry weight per volume of water). The daily dry matter load in Hkaung Tung Hka Chaung River varied between 2.3 and 2,900 t. The mean load was 359 t/d, with by far the largest amount being transported by the river during the rainy season during times of high discharge. That indicates that, in addition to direct inputs from mining activity, there was also suspended matter input from soil erosion and from the remobilization of river sediments. The estimates of the annual input into Indawgyi Lake came to an amount of about 133,000 t. This corresponds to a volume of the fresh matter between 0.26 and 0.4 million m³. The results show the urgent need for a control of the artisanal small-scale gold mining activities and for the building of sedimentation basins at Hkaung Tung Hka Chaung River to protect Indawgyi Lake with its highly valuable ecosystem.",,"Leßmann, Dieter; Grüneberg, Björn",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5685,,OPUS4-5685,Bericht
Against forgetting : investigating and preserving historic buildings in a Himalayan village,,"For more than a decade, the interconnected structures of the Buddhist earthen heritage in Wanla village/Ladakh, illustrated most prominently by the historic Avalokiteshvara Temple, have been researched, conserved, and restored by the NGOs Achi Association and Achi Association India.

Risk and return of passive and active commodity futures strategies,,"Over the last decades, commodity futures markets have grown significantly because, in addition to hedgers using futures for risk management, investors have discovered the potential of futures in investment products. Motivated by this growing importance, this thesis is concerned with the analysis of risk (in terms of the established risk measure Expected Shortfall) and investment strategies in commodity futures markets. First, we compare popular non-parametric estimators of Expected Shortfall (i. e., different variants of historical, outlier-adjusted and kernel methods) to each other, selected parametric benchmarks and estimates based on the idea of forecast combination within a multidimensional simulation setup (spanned by different distributional settings, sample sizes and confidence levels). We rank the estimators on the basis of classic error measures as well as an innovative performance profile technique, which we adapt from the mathematical programming literature. Our rich set of results supports academics and practitioners in the search for an answer to the question of which estimators are preferable under which circumstances. After that, we present a full-scale analysis of Expected Shortfall in commodity futures markets. Besides illustrating the dynamics of historic Expected Shortfall, we evaluate whether popular estimators are suitable for forecasting future Expected Shortfall. By implementing a new backtest, we find that the performance of estimators hinges on market stability. Estimators tend to fail when markets are in turmoil and accurate forecasts are urgently needed. Even though a kernel method performs best on average, our results advise against the use of established estimators for risk (and margin) prediction. Third, motivated by the deteriorating performance of traditional cross-sectional momentum strategies in commodity futures markets, we propose to resurrect momentum by incorporating autocorrelation information into the asset selection process. Put differently, we introduce measures of short and long memory (variance ratios and Hurst coefficients, respectively) telling us whether past winners and losers are likely to persist or not. Our empirical findings suggest that a memory-enhanced momentum strategy based on variance ratios significantly outperforms traditional momentum in terms of reward and risk, effectively prevents momentum crashes and is not bound to the movement of the overall commodity market. Furthermore, strategy returns cannot be explained by typical factor portfolios and macroeconomic variables and are robust to various parametrization choices, alternative data sets, transaction costs and data mining. Finally, and in contrast to a newly emerging strand of literature promoting the benefits of long memory measures in portfolio management, we show that Hurst coefficients do not carry investment-relevant information in a commodity momentum context.",,"Mehlitz, Julia Sophia",2021,,,OPUS4-5697,Dissertation
Planning inspection flights with an inhomogeneous fleet of micro aerial vehicles,,"We consider the problem of planning an inspection flight to a given set of waypo- ints using an inhomogeneous fleet of multirotor, battery-driven micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). Therein, two subproblems must be solved. On the one side, the detailed trajectories of all MAVs must be planned, taking technical and environmental restrictions into account and on the other side, the MAVs must be assigned to the waypoints considering their installed equipment. The goal is to visit all waypoints in minimal time. The strong interaction of the two subproblems makes it necessary to tackle them simultaneously. Several aspects are taken into account to allow realistic solutions. A two-level time grid approach is applied to achieve smooth trajectories, while the flight dynamics of the MAVs are modeled in great detail. Safety distances must be maintained between them and they can recharge at charging stations located within the mission area. There can be polyhedral restricted air spaces that must be avoided. Furthermore, weather conditions are incorporated by polyhedral wind zones affecting the drones and each waypoint has a time window within it must be visited. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear program and show whether the state-of-the-art numerical solver Gurobi is applicable to solve model instances.",,"Schmidt, Johannes; Fügenschuh, Armin",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5656,,OPUS4-5656,Arbeitspapier
Use of close-to-nature surfactants and microbiological degradation for improving the remediation of crude oil contaminated soils in the Nigerian Niger-Delta,,"The existence of large deposit of crude oil in the Nigerian Niger-Delta accords the region a strategic position in the country's economy. However, activities associated with the oil and gas industry have resulted in extensive and in some instances indelible damages on the ecosystems. The destructive effect of hydrocarbon on bionetwork necessitated this study that aimed at evaluating the potential of adopting microbial and biosurfactant technology as tools for bioremediation. The research involved gas chromatography monitoring of hydrocarbon degradation in polluted soil, microbiological/molecular identification of hydrocarbon degraders and the evaluation of biosurfactant production by indigenous bacteria. The performance of four treatments involving; co-treatment with mixed bacterial consortium and close-to-nature surfactants (Bioversal QF and Bioversal UK), treatments with mixed bacteria culture, single bacteria culture and treatment with close-to-nature surfactants only were evaluated for the mineralization of hydrocarbons contained in 500g of 2% crude oil contaminated soil supplemented with Na2HPO4*2H2O, KH2PO4 and NH4Cl as nutrient sources over a period of 20 weeks. Six indigenous biosurfactant producing and/or hydrocarbon degrading bacteria strains were isolated namely: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus sp, Achromobacter sp, Stenotrophonas sp, Lysinibacillus sp. and Delftia sp. Molecular characterization of sequenced polymerase chain reaction products of these cultured bacteria using Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool confirmed close relationships ranging from 98.83% to 100% with those on the NCBI databank. Co-treatment with mixed bacteria culture and Bioversal UK/Bioversal QF yielded synergetic impact that enhanced 73.35% and 71.52% degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbon respectively. Treatments with close-to-nature surfactants and with mix bacterial culture recorded 53.61% and 54.58%. The use of single bacteria strains resulted in the mineralization of 46% - 62.26% total petroleum hydrocarbon while their use as a consortium yielded 54%. Liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry assessment of extracellular polymeric substances produced by cultured bacteria strains indicated the presence of rhamnolipids (L-rhamnosyl-3-hydroxydecanoyl-3-hydroxydecanoic acid with a mass of 504.654 Da) and lipopeptides (2-(Hydroxymethyl) phenyl 6-O-palmitoyl-&#946;-D-glucopyranoside with a mass of 524.687 Da). Extracellular polymeric substances produced yielded emulsion index ranging from 70.70% to 75% and 39% to 65% with crude oil and heptane respectively. EPS yields ranging from 1.34 g/ml to 1.5 g/ml were recorded.",,"Dido, Mann Samuel",2021,,,OPUS4-5730,Dissertation

Scale dissonances between local and world heritage : the rural landscape of the Palladian villa,,"This research critically analyses the visual representation of the Palladian villa landscape as UNESCO World Heritage. I bring to light certain dissonances around the understanding of this landscape as heritage between global and local perspective. I have explored the ways in which the rural landscape of the Palladian villas is produced by ICOMOS experts, local institution and inhabitants in the contemporary context of the suburban areas of the Veneto region in Italy. Dissonances are arising when the landscape transforms and the visual integrity, or the iconic image of the landscape get lost. I observed that, the loss of the visual integrity, considered as negative by ICOMOS experts, gives space to peculiar heritage social practices from below. I am problematizing two main aspects of the conservation scheme of this site: the selective visual representation of history and the musealization of agriculture for touristic proposes. I am exploring the potential of reframing and renaming the conservation scheme of the World Heritage Site. I suggest using inhabitant's visual representation to reframe the UNESCO management plan and considering the peculiar local agricultural practice as a ""continuing cultural landscape"". I interpret my empirical and theoretical contribution as a semantic shift in the way the Palladian rural landscape is understood as World Heritage toward an inclusive and situated heritage conservation that extend beyond expert's conservation philosophies. The research contributes to the deconstruction of modern notions of rural landscape and heritage in the field of heritage studies and landscape conservation especially within the implementation of the World Heritage Convention.",,"Torelli, Valentina",2021,,,OPUS4-5537,Dissertation

Development and validation of a gas-liquid two-phase model for industrial computational fluid dynamics applications,,"A local algebraic simulation model was developed, to determine the characteristic length scales for dispersed phases. This model includes the Ishii- Zuber drag model, the lift, the wall lubrication force and the turbulent dispersion force as well. It is based on the Algebraic Interface Area Density (AIAD) model from the Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf (HZDR), which provides the morphology detection and the free surface drag model. The developed model is in agreement with the current state of knowledge based on an examination of the theory and of state of science models for interface momentum transfer. This new simulation model was tested on three different experiments. Two experiments can be found in the literature, the Fabre 1987 and the Hewitt 1987 experiment. And the third simulation is based on a steam drum experiment. This steam drum experiment is designed with ERK Eckrohrkessel GmbH internals and was developed to examine the droplet mass flow out of the turbulent separation stage. The implementation of all models and tests was performed using Ansys CFX. The first analysis was carried out to reproduce a wavy stratified flow to examine the effects of different simulation model set-ups according to the velocity and kinetic energy profiles, as well as the pressure drop gradient and the water level measured by Fabre 1987. The second analysis was a proof on concept for reproducing the vertical flow pattern by an experiment from Hewitt 1987. The third simulation analysed the water distribution in the steam drum and feeding pipes system as well as the droplet carryover into the gas phase in the turbulent separation region of the drum. These simulations have shown, that the accuracy of the particle distribution model in interaction with the drag and non-drag forces is able to reproduce horizontal and vertical flow patterns. Higher deviations are recognised for the liquid volume fraction close above the interface. Generally, simulations can now be performed to optimise industrial steam drum designs.",,"Nowitzki, Mario",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5413,,OPUS4-5413,Dissertation
"Evaluation of water situation and development of drinking water management plan for Aba City, Southeast Nigeria",,"The impact of urbanization on the quality of drinking water sources is a challenge in many developing countries. In this research, the main source of drinking water was quantified, quality baseline defined, and a thematic decision support management tool developed to protect the quality using Aba, Nigeria. Data from primary and secondary sources were obtained from desktop search, empirical instruments, satellite data, hydrogeological investigations and water quality assessment. Geoscientific and statistical tools were used to analyse the landform, characterize the land use, and create management tools to protect the water source. The results revealed that groundwater is the main source of water for both domestic and industrial uses. An average water consumption per capita rate of 35.9 l/day was estimated, which is low compared to the WHO recommendation. The landform and land-use analyses revealed that the area is low-lying, poorly drained, and the urban land-use is the fastest-growing class growing averagely at 0.6% /annum between 1986 to 2017. Some of the urban land-use practices that harm the quality of the groundwater were identified and mapped in a contamination hotspot map. The results of the twenty-one quality indicators in the groundwater showed that the pH was acidic (3.7-5.6), total dissolved solids (TDS) ranged between 6.5 mg/l-364 mg/l. The mean concentrations of the remaining indicators were within the WHO limits for drinking water quality. But, the EC, TDS, chloride and nitrate revealed significant differences when tube-wells between densely and sparse built-up areas are compared. Again, four dominant water types were identified in groundwater. The Na-HCO3 water type was dominant mostly in the sparse built-up area and it is assumed as the background groundwater facies in the area. Whereas Mg, Ca-Cl, Na-Cl and Ca-HCO3 water types were predominant in the densely built-up area. The bacteriological assessments of drinking water from natural and alternative (i.e. beverages and packaged water) sources revealed the presence of E. Coli and Coliform bacteria in some samples of the natural water. The groundwater quality distribution and vulnerability assessment maps were developed based on water quality index, and DRASTIC methodologies, respectively. The quality distribution map showed that > 98% of the area has a ""suitable"" rating. While the vulnerability assessment map found that the groundwater has a ""medium"" baseline vulnerability covering about 80%. The differences in the results were due to some observed poor urban land-use practices in the area. Finally, a thematic decision support tool that delineates priority monitoring zones and suggests possible source protected areas tailored for the area was developed. This tool is cost-effective in protecting the groundwater quality and can be applied to other developing urban areas with similar physiological conditions.",,"Ijioma, Uche Dickson",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5589,,OPUS4-5589,Dissertation
Dielectrophoretic manipulation of yeast cells using CMOS integrated microfluidic,,"The rapid detection of infectious diseases is still an unsolved problem since their identification must be carried out either by cultivation or DNA analysis in a laboratory. The development of point-of-care (PoC) is a current development trend that requires further technological impulses to produce reliable and cost-effective systems. By miniaturizing and integrating microfluidic and electronic components, the advantages of electronic methods can be transferred to the field of PoC testing. The combination of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology with microfluidic platforms allowed the development of fully functional sample-to-result LoC setups, which served the portability of the device even out of the laboratory or hospitals. CMOS-based LoC device can control and manage the data from sensors, microfluidics, and actuators. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a non-destructive and non-invasive method promising to be used in PoC medical applications. Utilizing MEMS technology and fabrication of microelectrodes allow DEP to be applied in biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and separation with high speed, sensitivity and without any labeling. Cell detection and separation occupy an important place in diagnostics of viral and infectious diseases such as Influenza and COVID-19. Therefore, rapid, sensitive, and automated LoC devices are needed to detect such diseases. Starting from this point of view, manipulating the cells as a way to detect them using DEP was decided as the main objective of the thesis. This work aimed at developing a miniaturized CMOS integrated silicon microfluidic device, in line with a standard CMOS procedure, for characterization and manipulation of live and dead yeast cells using the DEP technique. Understanding the relationship between the microelectrode's geometry and the magnitude of DEP force, the microfluidic devices can be designed to produce the most effective DEP implication on biological samples. In this work, interdigitated electrode arrays (IDEs) were used to manipulate the cells. This microelectrode was primarily used to detect microorganisms in a solution, based on the measurement of the variation of the dielectric constant by the concentration of the microorganisms. Therefore, finite element simulations were performed to optimize this microelectrode and adapt it to our application. Thus, the IDEs were optimized as a function of finger width and spacing between adjacent fingers. One of the most serious matters related to DEP-based microfluidic devices is that the DEP spectra of the targeted cell should precisely be known. Therefore, the DEP spectrum analysis of various cell suspensions with different medium conductivities was studied comprehensively by finite element simulation and experimentally. This study presented an optimized trapping platform for both detection and separation applications in terms of electrode dimension and electrical parameters.",,"Matbaechi Ettehad, Honeyeh",2021,,,OPUS4-5531,Dissertation
Spike - a tool for reproducible simulation experiments,,"Reproducibility of simulation experiments is still a significant challenge and has attracted considerable attention in recent years. One cause of this situation is bad habits of the scientific community. Many results are published without data or source code, and only a textual description of the simulation set-up is provided. Other causes are: no complete simulation set-up, no proper output data analysis and inconsistency of published data, which makes it impossible to compare results. The progress of computational modelling, amount of data and complexity of models requires designing experiments in such a way that ensures reproducibility. A textual description does not provide all the needed details. A computer code is more reliable than a textual description. It is the precise specification that describes a simulation configuration, model, etc. When computer code, data, models and all parameters are provided, the simulation results become reproducible. The main goal of this thesis is to develop a tool that ensures reproducibility and efficient execution of simulation experiments, often involving many individual simulation runs. The tool should support a wide range of application scenarios, where the typical scenario is simulation of biochemical reaction networks, which are represented as (coloured) Petri nets interpreted in the stochastic, continuous or hybrid paradigm.

Parallel constraint solving for combinatorial problems,,"With parallelism becoming the standard in computer design, research on parallel constraint solving technique is of vital importance for enhancing the performance of constraint solving. In this dissertation, we reviewed the literature on exploiting parallelism in constraint solving to help gain insight into the rationale of different types of parallel constraint solving approaches. On this basis, we analyzed the effectiveness of parallel constraint solving, with the focus on obtaining a first solution when solving computationally hard combinatorial problems. We have shown that a well-designed search space splitting method and constraint programming model can enable the embarrassingly parallel search (EPS) to solve some open instances of the social golfer problem that have not been solved by a sequential algorithm. We also observed superlinear speedups when solving these instances, which confirms our theoretical analysis. Besides, we examined two practical constraint optimization problems, including the traveling tournament problem with predefined venues and the talent scheduling problem. Our proposed constraint models outperformed the existing models on the same instances, and the EPS approach could always attain better feasible solutions in terms of the optimal objective value by using more parallel processors. To explore the use of massively parallel processing, we proposed the parallel stochastic portfolio search, which is a simple and non-intrusive way to parallelize different incarnations of a sequential solver. When comparing the existing portfolio to our portfolio approach by solving the same constraint satisfaction problems using the same constraint models, our technique could solve harder and larger instances. The successes of our new parallel approaches are attributed to early diversity; i.e., some diversity early in the search introduced by parallelism can offset early mistakes caused by weak heuristic choices.

Training of artificial neuronal networks with nonlinear optimization techniques,,"Machine learning is a field that has been the object of study of many researchers around the globe during the last decades. Very often to solve machine learning challenges like classification problems for example, one needs to train an artificial neural network. To train this network a certain loss function has to be minimized. There is a ubiquitous approach to achieve this which consists of using variants of the stochastic gradient descent combined with the backpropagation algorithm. In our work, we aimed at testing a rather non-conventional scheme consisting of making use of the solvers a software called AMPL offers.",,"Tchouto Mbatchou, Thierry",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5404,,OPUS4-5404,Bachelorarbeit

The transformation of the urban landscape in the old city of Baghdad between 1854 -2009,,"The old city core experienced a long series of modernization process that affected the old urban fabric and the coherence among urban elements. This dissertation tried to explore the intervention methods and the variety of impacts that have been occurred inside the old core . New streets that were added to the city changed the urban space hierarchy in each time. Starting from analyzing the spatial form via exploring the morphology of the city up to analyze the city skyline is the main methodology of this work. The spatial form of the city of Baghdad shows the impacts of multi planning approaches belong to variant master plans which were proposed and achieved to manage the city growth and development. Those impacts were varied and explained in this dissertation based on the change in the city network, city expansion and land use distribution. The old city of Baghdad was analyzed and explained in details in term of investigating the morphological layers for different periods showing the development of Baghdad urban structure by new comparative plans that explain the change between two following morphological periods. The understanding of the transformation in each morphological period was based on the following criteria's (urban growth, urban space development, urban components and innovations) to provide a comprehensive investigation about the behavior of the urban components. The investigation of the main old and new streets was well assessed showing their structure, building typologies and the role of the urban space typologies along the segments of those streets. The transect analysis method was used by having nine sections through the old city in different areas to understand the transformation in the city of Baghdad and the impacts of the unregulated development process accompanied within the lack of clear urban management method. The development of the city skyline provided a clear interpretation about the impacts of inserting new urban space and building typologies inside the old core. It was so clear that the hypothesis of this dissertation was proved in showing the role of the street hierarchy change (for both pedestrian and car street in different segments) in exploring the mechanism of the conflict among urban components that bring more destruction to the city. The conclusion showed what to avoid in any prospective rehabilitation process and gave the impacts of the previous interventions that shoud not be repeated in the future.",,"Al-Hasani, Mohammed K.",2021,,,OPUS4-5381,Dissertation
Optimising ICOMOS' 'Heritage at Risk' initiatives : towards a comprehensive framework for cultural heritage at risk,,"Cultural heritage faces many types of threats such as neglect, conflicts, disasters caused by natural and human induced hazards, unplanned infrastructure projects, climate change, etc. Over time, a number of institutions, organisations, programmes and initiatives to address the issues related to heritage at risk through varied modes of interventions such as advocacy work, conservation efforts, funding, awareness-raising regarding particular sites, etc. have emerged. Despite the stimulus and support of the various institutions, organisations and initiatives, diverse threats continue to impact cultural heritage in present times with some factors amplifying more than before, leading to the subsequent damages to or losses of heritage assets. Though reasons for these issues are varied and complex, one of the important factors to look into is the agency of the diverse 'Heritage at Risk' programmes or initiatives. ICOMOS being one of the pioneers in this global discourse of threatened heritage, its role is strategically vital. 20 years after ICOMOS's first attempts to initiate one of the first 'Heritage at Risk' programmes, this research is an opportunity to re-examine and analyse the effectiveness of ICOMOS' 'Heritage at Risk' programme within the current organisational/ institutional landscape of initiatives in the field of heritage at risk, that ICOMOS is embedded in. It is also an opportunity to situate the programme within the diverse views of the heritage at risk framework and the continuing shifts in the foundational paradigms of the international discourse on heritage conservation. The purpose of this analysis is to guide programme improvement for optimising efforts in favour of cultural heritage at risk within and/ or beyond ICOMOS and improve their ability to contribute towards - safeguarding heritage at risk, increasing the resilience of cultural heritage and sustainable development.",,"Bardhan, Jayashree",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5620,,OPUS4-5620,Masterarbeit / Diplomarbeit
Fuzzy coloured Petri nets for modelling biological systems with uncertain kinetic parameters,,"Over the last twenty years, Petri nets have been increasingly adopted for modelling and simulating biological systems, as they offer an intuitive and graphical approach for this purpose. Their usability convenience comes from the fact that they offer many types of elements to describe systems in a qualitative and quantitative way. Coloured Petri nets are particularly useful to model systems with repeated components in a compact fashion. Our tool Snoopy for modelling and simulating Petri nets is one of the most well-known tools supporting a family of related Petri net classes comprising stochastic, continuous and hybrid Petri nets, and covering uncoloured and coloured Petri nets alike. However, kinetic information of a biological system, i.e. kinetic parameters may be uncertain, due to many reasons, e.g. environmental factors. Besides, coloured Petri nets as they were previously supported in Snoopy suffered from some inconsistencies. Due to these inconsistencies, exploring the model behaviour using different sizes (scaleability) was not feasible. Both challenges call for a new and more powerful approach integrating the modelling of uncertainties together with modelling features supporting repeated structures in a compact and scalable way. This thesis comprises two major contributions: Firstly, we introduce the definition and present the simulation algorithm for both uncoloured and coloured fuzzy Petri nets, by extending the existing quantitative uncoloured and coloured Petri nets in Snoopy. This includes discretising the uncertain kinetic parameters to crisp values by using sampling strategies. Secondly, we harmonise coloured Petri nets in Snoopy with their uncoloured counterparts and we extend the Snoopy's coloured Petri nets by all the features, which are supported by the coloured abstract net description language - an exchange format of coloured Petri nets in our PetriNuts tool family. By performing fuzzy simulation, one can obtain two kinds of output: fuzzy bands of each output variable and their corresponding timed-membership functions. Each fuzzy band describes the uncertainties associated with the input, whereas membership functions give more accurate information about the associated uncertainties. The most important features that we obtain by harmonising coloured Petri nets are to develop scaleable models, by defining scaling factors as constants and unifying the usage of coloured Petri nets with the other tools in our PetriNuts tool family.",,"Assaf, George",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5851,,OPUS4-5851,Dissertation
Experiments on nonlinear waves in homogeneous flows with free upper surface and time-dependent forcing,,"The linear-theory assumption is a fundamental approach for the study of waves in fluids. The governing equations are linearized by assuming the perturbations are small so that the consequences of nonlinear terms are negligible. Nevertheless, if a wave approaches a critical level, in which the wave amplitude grows so as to create an instability of the background flow, the assumption of linearity may not hold any longer. In this case, the nonlinear terms are required to be taken into consideration. In this thesis, two experimental setups have been proposed for the study of two scenarios, in which the nonlinear effects become significant and a traditional linear solution is no longer valid. The first experiment focuses on an inertially oscillating rotating fluid. In the thesis, we present experimental results from a system that is simpler than classical precession experiments but still shows very similar wave interactions and a collapse to turbulence. This system consists of a partly filled rotating annulus that rotates about its symmetry axis slightly tilted with respect to the gravity vector. In the experiments, we find a resonant collapse when the forcing frequency corresponds with a resonant frequency of the rotating tank. Two types of instability can be triggered: a parametric triadic instability, in which two free Kelvin modes arise and form a triad with the forced Kelvin mode, and a shear-type instability related to the nonlinearly excited geostrophic flow. The latter instability gives rise to a barotropic mode that interacts with the forced mode and generates secondary modes. We also observed dependency of the mode frequencies on the Ekman number, which can, at least partly, be explained by a Doppler shift due to the mean flow. Finally, we try to connect our data to a low-order dynamical system based on the weakly nonlinear theory that describes the main features of single triad interaction in precession experiments. The second experiment concerns the study of undular bores (or tidal bores), in which the nonlinearity plays an important role. An experiment has been performed in which undular bores are produced in an open circular channel. More specifically, two different cases have been investigated: a single bore case with a rigid boundary setup and a bore colliding case with a periodic lateral boundary setup. Bores are generated by abruptly releasing a barrier that separates fluids with different surface levels. Up to our knowledge, this is the first experimental study of undular bores in a circular channel. For a setup without barriers, this geometry accomplishes in a natural way the periodic lateral boundary conditions, which is very often used in numerical simulations. The experimental results have been compared with the nonlinear numeric simulations and achieved an excellent agreement.",,"Xu, Wenchao",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5386,,OPUS4-5386,Dissertation
Mixed-integer programming for additive manufacturing,,"Since the beginning of its development in the 1950s, mixed integer programming (MIP) has been used for a variety of practical application problems, such as sequence optimization. Exact solution techniques for MIPs, most prominently branch-and-cut techniques, have the advantage (compared to heuristics such as genetic algorithms) that they can generate solutions with optimality certificates. The novel process of additive manufacturing opens up a further perspective for their use. With the two common techniques, Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) and Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBD), the sequence in which a given component geometry must be manufactured can be planned. In particular, the heat transfer within the component must be taken into account here, since excessive temperature gradients can lead to internal stresses and warpage after cooling. In order to integrate the temperature, heat transfer models (heat conduction, heat radiation) are integrated into a sequencing model. This leads to the problem class of MIPDECO: MIPs with partial differential equations (PDEs) as further constraints. We present these model approaches for both manufacturing techniques and carry out test calculations for sample geometries in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.",,"Beisegel, Jesse; Buhl, Johannes; Israr, Rameez; Schmidt, Johannes; Bambach, Markus; Fügenschuh, Armin",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5731,,OPUS4-5731,Arbeitspapier
A two-time-level model for mission and flight planning of an inhomogeneous fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles,,"We consider the mission and flight planning problem for an inhomogeneous fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Therein, the mission planning problem of assigning targets to a fleet of UAVs and the flight planning problem of finding optimal flight trajectories between a given set of waypoints are combined into one model and solved simultaneously. Thus, trajectories of an inhomogeneous fleet of UAVs have to be specified such that the sum of waypoint-related scores is maximized, considering technical and environmental constraints. Several aspects of an existing basic model are expanded to achieve a more detailed solution. A two-level time grid approach is presented to smooth the computed trajectories. The three-dimensional mission area can contain convex-shaped restricted airspaces and convex subareas where wind affects the flight trajectories. Furthermore, the flight dynamics are related to the mass change, due to fuel consumption, and the operating range of every UAV is altitude-dependent. A class of benchmark instances for collision avoidance is adapted and expanded to fit our model and we prove an upper bound on its objective value. Finally, the presented features and results are tested and discussed on several test instances using GUROBI as a state-of-the-art numerical solver.",,"Schmidt, Johannes; Fügenschuh, Armin",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5461,,OPUS4-5461,Arbeitspapier
How software engineers deal with decisions in Scrum - An analysis,,"The Agile Manifesto titled ""Working software over comprehensive documentation"". Although the stated principle makes an important point, it should not follow that documentation becomes obsolete. On the contrary, agile software development (ASD) is based on frequent decisions focused on customer benefits. Those decisions guide further development, subsequent maintenance, and software evolution and are made during every stage of the software development cycle. Thus, documenting the most important ones is an important foundation fostering product comprehension, software quality, and customer benefit. Besides, preserving decision knowledge supports refactoring and, thus, diminishing software erosion. However, all these beneficial properties are opposed by a dismissive attitude among software developers. Documentation is very unpopular among software developers, especially in the ASD community. A common interpretation of the agile manifesto at this point is that good and functional code can fully replace documentation. Among other reasons, this attitude is the reason for the sparse application of structured and systematic documentation of decisions and their rationale. To shed more light on imponderables, developer's desires regarding decision documentation, and assess the outlined perception of a lack of decision documentation, this paper reports a survey on decision documentation in Scrum among industry practitioners. The author assesses to what extent the above claims hold by asking industry practitioners about their perceptions and applied practices regarding decision documentation in Scrum. Therefore, the author conducted a large-scale survey in the German and English speaking Scrum community. A few more than 100 software developers were asked what they document, how they document and how they use/share produced documentation. The findings of this report reveal that there is a wide range of opinions in the agile community. The responses show that a developer's experience significantly impacts the documentation frequency and the interest in the available documentation. Similarly, the role in which software developers have operated in Scrum plays a significant role in the frequency of documentation and the timing when developers document.",,"Schubanz, Mathias",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5066,,OPUS4-5066,Bericht
Practical approach to reclamation of post-mining sites,,"In order to integrate necessary interdisciplinary complexity, sustainability, defined targets and endpoints for reclamation progress, the objective of this research is to advance reclamation knowledge on (i) international scale and (ii) national scale, taking Nigeria as an example. On the international scale (i), a systematic reclamation threshold scale for assessing, evaluating, documenting, and monitoring reclamation progress was developed. The threshold stages begin from the initial state I0 down to degraded state D0 (depending on the type of mining). Reclamation starts with soil reconstruction R-2 up to revegetation R-1 (red zones) to reach minimum threshold R0 (amber zone). Beyond R0 are the green zones R1, R2, and R3 representing soil/abiotic condition, biological and improved threshold respectively. Adaptation of the threshold model to degraded ecosystems in national and international laws is recommended. On the national scale with Nigeria (ii), endowed with over 34 solid minerals and abundant crude oil, findings show that almost all mine sites are below the minimum threshold scale R0. The sites are adversely affected by Artisanal and Small Scale Mining (ASM), whereby, contamination and soil lithology disturbances are the state-of-the-art discussions. However, bioremediation (phytoremediation) is the most feasible remediation technique. Therefore, for the crude oil contaminated sites, this study highlights typical cogitation for large in-situ implementation and potential species for remediation. For the mineral resources, gold mining was the typical example. As a practical approach, experimental areas on an abandoned mining site (Site 1), an active mining site (Site 2) and an undisturbed vegetation site (Control) in southwestern Nigeria were mapped out to represent its mining and farming activities. On the sites, (a) the impacts of the ASM activities on the floristic association were assessed. (b) the potential of 2D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was explored to characterize the horizontal and vertical landscape homogeneity of the mine sites, and lastly, (c) the study identified native high-accumulating plants growing on the sites that can be employed for phytoremediation. Thus, the results show that (a) the floristic association of the mine sites have been stressed and disturbed. (b) the resistivity structure of the sites shows that ASM has greatly impaired the lithological status of the sites. (c) out of the 9 considered species, Crinum jagus has the highest accumulation factor of 8.71, 37.47, 1.08 and 29.38 for Pb, Cd, Fe and Cu respectively. It is a recommendable novel plant in the tropics. However, future studies must verify its hyperaccumulator potentials, identify other high accumulating species and develop effective approaches and policies to curb ASM activities and enhance remediation in Nigeria.",,"Adesipo, Adegbite Adeleke",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5871,,OPUS4-5871,Dissertation
A 2D layered graph approach for scheduling delivery robots,,"In recent years parcel volumes reached record highs. The logistics industry is seeking new innovative concepts to keep pace. For densely populated areas delivery robots are a promising alternative to conventional trucking. These electric robots drive autonomously on sidewalks and deliver urgent goods, such as express parcels, medicine, or meals. The limited cargo space and battery capacity of these vehicles necessitates a depot visit after each customer served. The problem can be formulated as an electric vehicle routing problem with soft time windows and a single unit capacity. The goal is to serve all customers such that the quadratic sum of delays is minimized and each vehicle operates within its battery bounds. To solve this problem, we formulate an MIQP and present an expanded formulation based on a layered graph. For this layered graph we derive two solution approaches based on relaxations, which use less nodes and arcs. The first, Iterative Refinement, always solves the current relaxation to optimality and refines the graph if the solution is not feasible for the expanded formulation. This is repeated until a proven optimal solution is found. The second, Branch and Refine, integrates the graph refinement into a branch and bound framework avoiding restarts. Computational experiments performed on modified Solomon instances demonstrate the advantage of using our solution approaches and show that Branch and Refine outperforms Iterative Refinement in all studied parameter configurations.",,"Gnegel, Fabian; Schaudt, Stefan; Clausen, Uwe; Fügenschuh, Armin",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5493,,OPUS4-5493,Arbeitspapier
Targeted generation and suppression of the deformation mechanism and residual stresses in incremental sheet forming to improve the geometric accuracy,,"The geometric accuracy of an incrementally formed part is dependent on the underlying deformation mechanism and the residual stresses induced in the material during forming. This thesis presents new insights into the deformation mechanism and residual stresses of the Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) variant of the ISF process. In addition, strategies to control, suppress and adjust the deformation mechanism and residual stresses to increase the geometric accuracy and improve part properties are presented. The deformation mechanism of the ISF process is investigated. A novel methodology is developed to split the plastic energy dissipation during the SPIF process as a contributions of energies from dominant deformation modes. It is found that the dominant deformation mode can be bending, shear or membrane stretching, depending on the selected values of the process parameters. By controlling the contribution of each deformation mechanism, the outcome of the SPIF process can be designed for maximum geometric accuracy within the constraints of process time and formability. The build-up of the residual stresses in the SPIF process is investigated and a relation between the geometric accuracy and the residual stresses under changing process parameters is developed. The wall angle parameter has the highest influence on residual stresses. Moreover, the intensity and the magnitude of the residual stresses can be controlled by adjusting the process parameters. A direct approach based on post-forming Stress Relief Annealing (SRA) is developed to suppress residual stresses and increase geometric accuracy. In this regard, a modular tooling set-up is designed to perform the SRA under partial constraint. For maximum efficiency, optimal SRA parameters are determined. Two parts with practical significance are incrementally formed and subsequently stress relief annealed. A considerable increase in the geometric accuracy is observed with SRA in comparison to the parts without SRA. In the last part of this thesis, the very first approach is presented to generate a target distribution of high magnitude residual stresses in the ISF process for improving the mechanical properties. The desired residual stresses are generated in the conventionally formed disc springs in the surface treatment approach. In an integrated forming approach, the forming of the disc springs and the desired residual stresses are generated in a single step. Mechanical properties of the disc springs are better for both approaches in comparison to conventional disc springs. Hence, a targeted generation and distribution of the residual stresses to improve the mechanical properties is possible.",,"Maqbool, Fawad",2021,,,OPUS4-5564,Dissertation
A finite element approach for trajectory optimization in Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing,,"In wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), the desired workpiece is built layerwise by a moving heat source depositing droplets of molten wire on a substrate plate. To reduce material accumulations, the trajectory of the weld source should be continuous, but transit moves without welding, called deadheading, are possible. The enormous heat of the weld source causes large temperature gradients, leading to a strain distribution in the welded material which can lead even to cracks. In summary, it can be concluded that the temperature gradient reduce the quality of the workpiece. We consider the problem of finding a trajectory of the weld source with minimal temperature deviation from a given target temperature for one layer of a workpiece with welding segments broader than the width of the weld pool. The temperature distribution is modeled using the finite element method. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model and demonstrate its solvability by a standard mixed-integer solver.",,"Schmidt, Johannes; Buhl, Johannes; Fügenschuh, Armin",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5575,,OPUS4-5575,Arbeitspapier
Generating CQQL conditions from classifying CNNs,,"Convolutional neural networks are often successfully used for classification problems. Usually, a huge number of weights need to be learnt by use of training data. However, the learnt weights give no insight how the cnn really works. Thus, a cnn can be seen as a black box solution. In our approach we develop a method to generate a commuting quantum query language (cqql) condition from a sample derived from a given cnn or from training input. CQQL is inspired by quantum logic and its conditions obey the rules of Boolean algebra. The evaluation of a cqql condition provides values from the unit interval [0; 1] and establishes therefore an elegant bridge between logic and a cnn. The underlying assumption is that a condition (a logic expression) gives much more understanding than pure cnn weights. Furthermore, the rich theory of Boolean algebra can be used for manipulating logic expressions. After extracting a cqql condition from a cnn or its training data we can use logic as a way to predict classes alternatively to a cnn.",,"Schmitt, Ingo",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5550,,OPUS4-5550,Bericht
GALS methodology for substrate noise reduction in mixed-signal integrated circuits,,"Mixed signal integrated circuits (MSICs) contain both analog and digital circuitry, integrated together on the same die. While this integration brings many benefits, it also gives rise to the issue of substrate noise coupling between the noisy digital circuitry and noise-sensitive analog circuitry. In order to counteract this issue, various substrate noise reduction methodologies had been developed so far. This thesis explores a new approach in substrate noise reduction - using a GALS (globally-synchronous, locally-asynchronous) design strategy for the digital part of a MSIC, in order to reduce the noise generation at its source. GALS architectures consist of several locally synchronous modules (LSMs) which communicate asynchronously to each other. By converting an initially synchronous architecture of digital circuitry into a GALS architecture, simultaneous switching noise generated by this circuitry can be reduced. While GALS had already been used for reducing other types of simultaneous switching noise, this is, to the best of the author's knowledge, the first attempt to develop a GALS-based methodology for substrate noise reduction. In order to be able to theoretically analyze GALS-based methodologies for substrate noise suppression, corresponding models at high abstraction level for substrate noise generation and substrate noise propagation in lightly doped substrates (which is a type of substrate mostly used for MSICs) have been developed. These models have further been used for developing two new GALS-based substrate noise reduction methodologies: harmonic-balanced plesiochronous GALS partitioning (HB) and harmonic-and-area-based plesiochronous GALS partitioning with power domain separation (HAB). A theoretical analysis has shown that HB can reach substrate noise attenuation of up to 20log&#8289;(M), where M is the number of LSMs of the resulting GALS system. On the other hand, the attenuation achievable by HAB depends on the distribution of switching current harmonics and area among the partitions, as well as from the substrate itself. For each of the two methodologies, a suitable partitioning procedure for a practical application has been developed; these partitionig procedures have been numerically evaluated in MATLAB. HB has further been embedded within the EMIAS CAD tool, where it has been evaluated on a real design example - a wireless sensor node. A special case of HAB for low frequencies has been applied for developing a test chip called SGE (power domain Separation and Galsification Experiment). The measurements on silicon have proved the applicability of the methodology.",,"Babi&#263;, Milan",2021,,,OPUS4-5726,Dissertation
"MBE growth and investigation of Si, Ge, and Si&#8339;Ge&#8321;&#8331;&#8339; nanowires",,"Within this work, the growth of out-of-plane Si and SixGe1-x and in-plane Ge nanowire have been investigated. For this purpose, nanowires have been grown ccording to the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism by means of molecular beam epitaxy with Au as metallic solvent on Si(111) and nano-structured Si(001)/SiO2 substrates. Each stage from surface preparation to final nanowire growth has been examined in order to determine relevant parameters which influence the nucleation process nanowire elongation. Particular attention has been given to describe the variation of Au droplet size distribution on Si(111) to evaluate the subsequent nanowire growth and to obtain optimal growth conditions for an site-selective nucleation on the nano-structured substrates. Due to increased surface diffusion velocity with raising temperature, the droplet diameter distribution shifts from a positive skewed distribution with a high fraction of smaller droplets to a negative skewed distribution with a high fraction of larger droplets. The temperature dependency of the most probable droplet diameter and the number of Au droplets per area has been determined, which can be applied to predict the resulting nanowire diameters. The out-of-plane Si and SixGe1-x on Si(111) predominantly grow along the surface normal, exhibiting the characteristic sawtooth-like sidewall faceting. During the nanowire formation, the Au surface diffusion velocity increased and causes an increase of the most frequently observed diameter. Furthermore, the total number of droplets/nanowires decreases by a constant factor due to an increase of the contact angle during Si/Ge deposition. The specific diameter range for an possible nanowire formation is reduced by the incorporation of Ge into SixGe1-x nanowires. To obtain a regular and uniform nanowire growth, a nano-structured substrate consisting of Si(001) terminated pillars surrounded by a SiO2 matrix has been utilized. The initial growth of Ge nanowire starting from Si-Au droplets with SixGe1-x nucleation from ternary alloy is discussed from a thermodynamic point of view and a model based on the Si-Ge-Au ternary phase diagram has been developed to predict the SixGe1-x concentration gradient in the nanowire base. The fully relaxed in-plane Ge nanowires occur within one of the four distinct in-plane &#10216;110&#10217; directions and nanowires are mainly bounded by two 55° inclined {111} facets and a less pronounced planar (001) top facet. High-resolution scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy reveals a slightly tilted growth of individual nanowires with respect to each other, causing an abrupt change in the orientation at junction points of interconnected nanowires.",,"Lange, Felix",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5751,,OPUS4-5751,Dissertation
The unit re-balancing problem,,"We describe the problem of re-balancing a number of units distributed over a geographic area. Each unit consists of a number of components. A value between 0 and 1 describes the current rating of each component. By a piecewise linear function this value is converted into a nominal status assessment. The lowest of the statuses determines the efficiency of a unit, and the highest status its cost. An unbalanced unit has a gap between these two. To re-balance the units, components can be transferred. The goal is to maximize the efficiency of all units. On a secondary level, the cost for the re-balancing should be minimal. We present a mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation for this problem, which describes the potential movement of components as a multi-commodity flow. The piecewise linear functions needed to obtain the status values are reformulated using inequalities and binary variables. This results in a mixed-integer linear program, and numerical standard solvers are able to compute proven optimal solutions for instances with up to 100 units. We present numerical solutions for a set of test instances and a bi-criteria objective function, and discuss the trade-off between cost and efficiency.",,"Dee, Robin; Fügenschuh, Armin; Kaimakamis, George",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5658,,OPUS4-5658,Arbeitspapier

A wide range of published experimental data in multi-setup experiments are selected - in freely propagating and burner stabilized premixed flames and in shock tubes and jet-stirred and flow, reactor to assess the performance of the developed mechanism. The reaction mechanism also considers the formation of nitrogen oxides and the reduction of nitrogen oxides depending on the conditions of the surrounding gas phase. The experimental data from the literature are interpreted with the help of the kinetic model developed in this thesis.",,"Shrestha, Krishna Prasad",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5709,,OPUS4-5709,Dissertation
Distributive aspects in the design of payments for ecosystem services and agri-environmental schemes,,"Payments for ecosystem services (PES) and agri-environmental schemes (AES) are often introduced with the goal to counteract overexploitation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss in forests and agricultural landscapes. Their ecological effectiveness and cost-effectiveness have been, however, repeatedly questioned in the literature. One way of increasing the cost-effectiveness of such schemes is spatial differentiation of payments, which reflects regional differences in conservation benefits and costs and thus maximizes the ecological effect achieved with available financial resources. Another major critique for PES and AES is that they often pursue poverty alleviation and rural development objectives, which can compromise their cost-effectiveness. As the Tinbergen rule in economic theory suggests, each policy goal requires a separate policy instrument. However, as other policy instruments, PES and AES have distributional effects. Especially in developing countries, where governments are often weak and less able to successfully implement multiple policies, the distributional effects might not be adequately addressed. The distributional implications of PES and AES could even have an adverse effect on the cost-effectiveness of the schemes, if due to low acceptance among the potential ecosystem service (ES) providers, participation rates in these voluntary schemes are lower than optimal or if transaction costs are affected. From an economic perspective, if distributional goals are important for the design of PES and AES, the fairness preferences of potential ES buyers should be considered. This thesis uses three case studies to address selected aspects of distribution and fairness in PES and AES from different perspectives. It provides insights into the preferences of potential ES buyers in Germany for distribution and other fairness aspects in PES and AES using two choice experiments and analyses possible distributional effects of cost-effective homogeneous and regionalized payments in AES. The surveys among potential ES buyers suggest preferences for maximin and equal distribution of payments, and preferences for animal welfare and biodiversity conservation (for local as well as for distant biodiversity), which could be directions for improvement of AES and PES. Regarding distributional impacts of AES, a trade-off between equality and cost-effectiveness is confirmed. Equity generally increases with improved cost-effectiveness of homogeneous payments. Spatially differentiated payments improve the cost-effectiveness substantially, by aligning the payments to the regional costs and the measures to the regional specifics and potential ecological benefits. However, they have substantial redistribution effects, poorer regions are adversely affected. This shows the importance of analyzing the distributional implications of cost-effective AES and PES on different spatial levels and calls for a holistic approach in policy evaluation and implementation.",,"Markova-Nenova, Nonka",2021,,,OPUS4-5818,Dissertation
Evaluating policy impacts of minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) on Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement,,"The Nigerian government has commenced the development of minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) as part of measures to achieve the energy and emissions savings target established in Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. It is expected that the implementation of MEPS will also help to address the challenges of unreliability of electricity supply and facilitate the desired energy-efficient appliance market transformation. The MEPS currently covers the three most energy-consuming electrical products in households (lighting, refrigerators, and air conditioners). This research relied on data collected from the survey of 384 households in the case study area of Enugu to study the policy impacts of the current MEPS and identify the potential for its improvement. The research also, empirically, investigated policy and institutional barriers against appliance energy efficiency improvement in the country. Three different policy scenarios were conceptualized to model the policy impacts of current MEPS: a scenario assuming no MEPS or a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, a policy scenario (PS) that considers the current MEPS, and an aggressive policy scenario (APS) that assumes the scaling up of the current MEPS to more stringent levels. The policy analysis modeling system (PAMS) was adopted to study the impacts of MEPS considering a policy implementation period of 2019 through 2030. The United Nations' integrated policy framework was also adopted as evaluation criteria to identify policy gaps in the existing policy measures and the identification of possible policy overlaps was conducted using content analysis. Based on the results, the implementation of the current standards would reduce annual residential electricity demand in the surveyed households by 37% compared to BAU. National-level policy impacts show that the implementation of more stringent MEPS would contribute about 11.3% of the national emissions reduction target reached in Nigeria's NDC. The research also finds out that key policy instruments (such as financial incentives) are still in their planning stages. Furthermore, the result from the content analysis reveals that the assigned institutional roles for the advancement of end-use energy efficiency are in some cases, not based on the statutory mandates of the respective institutions which create room for possible overlaps. To close the existing energy efficiency gaps and achieve effective energy-efficient appliance market transformation, the research underscores the need for a large-scale appliance market assessment to understand current baseline efficiency levels which will guide future policy designs and ensure that MEPS remain effective. The research also recommends key possible frameworks that can guide the design and implementation of financial incentive instruments to make energy-efficient investments more attractive.",,"Ezeamama, Anayo",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5459,,OPUS4-5459,Dissertation
My Wilderness : selected essays in creative writing,,"The essays in this volume were created in the courses ""Philosophy of Technology and Nature"" over two semesters from 2018 to 2020. Students in these courses were enrolled in different study programs and they came from countries all over the world. In lectures and seminars we discussed the different imaginaries of technology and nature, the history of this relation, and the various conceptualizations particularly those of the Western world. The idea of ""Nature as Wilderness"" did, and still does so, take an important place in this cultural setting. We discussed a chapter from the seminal book of William Cronnon, The Trouble with Wilderness (1996), before entering in our writing experiment. Students were asked to write an essay of three pages maximum about the topic ""My Wilderness"", based on the methodology of creative writing that was presented and discussed at length. Students had one week to produce their piece and in the following session we had a kind of play reading that is students presented the texts of their mates. After this event, the texts were carefully revised and images added.",,,2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5436,,OPUS4-5436,Arbeitspapier
Fundamentals of process design and control of Anaerobic Sequencing Batch Gas-Lift reactor regarding the mixing process,,"The Anaerobic Sequencing Batch Reactor (ASBR) operates by sequential batches, has been studied as an alternative treatment for different systems because of their versatility. The ASBR is applicable for the conversion of a wide variety of organic wastewaters to methane and carbon dioxide (biogas). The main factors affecting the overall performance of the ASBR are: agitation, Substrate/Biomass ratio, geometric configuration of the reactor and the feeding strategy. In this research the strategy agitation was carried out by used of a gaslift system coupled to an ASBR. The aim of the research was the creation of bases for the design and process control of an Anaerobic Sequencing Batch Gaslift Reactor on a laboratory scale in order to find the optimal operating regime and optimize the process. The type of gaslift system to be used is an internal loop with a concentric draught tube configuration, which enables the gas may be sparged either the draught tube or the annulus. The simple design of a gas lift reactor permits less expensive operation, requires less maintenance, low investment costs, low interference and low power consumption. Scientific and technical objectives of the research include the analysis of macro geometric dimensions of the reactor, developing innovative solutions for optimization of mixing process (gaslift mixing), analysis of the hydrodynamics and the homogenization inside of the reactor. This study also includes the flow determination in the riser, the evaluation of the liquid circulation velocity in the downcomer and the influence of the vertical draft tube and the effect of top and bottom clearance. Also, the goal was to find an adequate mixture to not destroy microorganisms but to allow the sedimented biomass and undigested solids may rise quickly and mixed with the feed substrate.",,"Pulgarin Monsalve, Isabel Cristina",2021,,,OPUS4-5569,Dissertation
Universal approaches in local circumstances : a series of discussions on policy-practice gaps in urban conservation (abstracts),,"Today, urban conservation scholarship calls for case studies that problematise universal conservation principles in local planning circumstances, particularly in countries from which modern conservation has not originated. In this series of workshops, we discuss singularities of urban conservation and the protection of historic urban areas with local experts who have been directly involved in processes of putting conservation policy documents into practice. We discuss how the planned goals of conservation projects are influenced by unplanned factors such as war, economic and political instability, inter-organisational conflicts, and natural hazards. The discussed cases represent cities with non-western cultural backgrounds that are geographically and culturally interconnected. By discussing urban conservation issues in Ankara, Baghdad, Tehran, Shiraz, Yazd, Kerman, Herat, and Mumbai, we aim to reflect on the functionality of mainstream conservation approaches in local conditions. The speakers share their local insight into obstacles of realising the international conservation models under rapidly changing natural and socio-political conditions. The workshops' moderators are outstanding young academics who have a deep understanding of the discussed issues and have co-planned the sessions with the speakers.

High-throughput QC-LDPC codes for next-generation wireless communication systems,,"Wireless communication has become an indispensable part of our life and the demand for achieving higher throughput with lower energy consumption is ever growing. The ambitious throughput of 100 Gb/s and beyond is now becoming a modest goal thanks to comprehensive advances in transmission technologies and protocols. One important aspect of these advances is with regard to channel coding methods and the ability to detect and correct errors at the receiver. Computations needed by such methods become generally more complicated as they become more powerful in their performance. This imposes a great challenge for researchers attempting to devise practical methods for encoding and decoding Forward-error Correction (FEC) techniques tailored for high-throughput scenarios. In this work we focus on high-throughput Quasi-Cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) codes, as they have been selected as one of the main FEC techniques for the two major next generation wireless technologies, namely Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax) and 5G. Our target is to develop complete encoding and decoding design for these codes in order to reach the throughput of 100 Gb/s with affordable power consumption. Toward this goal, we investigate first the appropriate encoder design for these codes which can be used at such high data-rate with reasonably low power consumption. Then we propose several novel ideas for improving the decoding performance and complexity of QC-LDPC codes. The proposed novel ideas collectively facilitate a decoder able to run at 50 Gb/s with less than 12 pJ/b energy consumption for a Latin squares QC-LDPC code. All the proposed methods are practical and implementable and their effectiveness are showcased by either Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) synthesis.",,"Hasani, Alireza",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5819,,OPUS4-5819,Dissertation
High-performance computing and laboratory experiments on strato-rotational instabilities,,"Stratified vortices can be found from small to large scales in geophysical and astrophysical flows. On the one hand, tornadoes and hurricanes can lead to devastation and even a large number of casualties. On the other hand, vortices can distribute heat and momentum in the atmosphere which is important for a habitable environment on Earth. In the astrophysical context, accretion disks (from which solar systems are formed) can be seen as stratified vortices. In such systems, understanding the mechanisms that can result in an outward transport of angular momentum is a central problem. For a planet or star to be formed in a disk, angular momentum has to be carried away from its center to allow matter aggregation by gravity; otherwise, its rotation speed would be far too large, avoiding this matter aggregation (and the consequent star formation) to happen. In such gas systems, turbulence is the most likely mechanism to achieve such a large angular momentum transport. However, it was shown that the flow profile of accretion disks is stable with respect to purely shear instabilities, and the question arises about how the turbulence can be generated. Among other candidates, the strato-rotational instability (SRI) has attracted attention in recent years. The SRI is a purely hydrodynamic instability that can be modeled by a classical Taylor-Couette (TC) system with stable density stratification due to axial salinity or temperature gradients. In this thesis, a combined experimental and high-performance computing study of new specific behaviors of the strato-Rotational Instability (SRI) is performed. The density stratification causes a change in the marginal instability transition when compared to classical non-stratified TC systems, making the flow unstable in regions where - without stratification - it would be stable. This characteristic makes the SRI a relevant phenomenon in planetary and astrophysical applications, particularly in accretion disk theory. Despite many advances in the understanding of strato-rotational flows, the confrontation of experimental data with non-linear numerical simulations remains relevant, since it involves linear aspects and non-linear interactions of SRI modes which still need to be better understood. These comparisons also reveal new non-linear phenomena and patterns not yet observed in the SRI, that can contribute to our understanding of geophysical flows.",,"Maltese Meletti de Oliveira, Gabriel",2021,,,OPUS4-5440,Dissertation
Direct numerical simulation of nonlinear pattern formation on the surface of liquid films,,"We investigate the dynamics of a Newtonian liquid layer bounded on one side by a horizontal and planar substrate and on the other side by its free and deformable surface. The system is subjected to a time-periodic gravitation field in lateral or normal direction. Based on a nonlinear coordinate transformation, which maps the time-dependent surface onto a constant domain and thus eliminates the need for tracking the interface, a finite-difference method on staggered grids is presented, allowing direct numerical simulations of the full incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two and three dimensions. Taking into account the continuity equation, a sparse linear system for the pressure is obtained from the discretized Navier-Stokes equations whose solution satisfies the conservation of momentum and mass, so that pressure corrections can be avoided. In the case of a harmonic force perpendicular to the substrate, we find in high frequency ranges the classical square patterns oscillating subharmonically with half of the driver's frequency. For a slow excitation, hexagonal Faraday waves emerge oscillating at the forcing frequency. Vertical two-frequency excitations lead to more complex patterns &#8212; surface waves having the shape of a square superlattice are found. In the case of a lateral excitation, the formation of coarsening droplets is observed. We show that ratchet-like forces generate a nonvanishing averaged flow rate inducing a preferred direction of motion of the drops. These results correspond well with those of a simplified model based on the lubrication approximation. Our investigations also include systems in Rayleigh-Taylor configuration, where the liquid is located on the underside of the substrate. By considering rigid walls instead of periodic boundaries, wave amplification due to resonance can be studied. The corresponding numerical results are in good agreement with experimentally obtained data.",,"Richter, Sebastian",2021,,,OPUS4-5431,Dissertation
A machine learning approach for churn prediction within the social network Jodel,,"Within the last decades, the number of social networks is growing fast. The competition of retaining the customers to grow their platform and increase their profitability is rising. That is why companies need to detect possible churners to retain these. The problem of predicting the users' lifetime, churning users, and the reasons for churning can be tackled by using machine learning. The goal of this bachelor thesis is to build machine learning models to predict user churn and the user lifetime within the social network Jodel, a location-based anonymous messaging application for Android and iOS. To get the best possible prediction results, we have started with extensive literature research, whose approaches we have tested and added to a machine learning pipeline to build predictive models. With these models, we have investigated the performance after different observation time windows and have finally compared the strongest models to detect similarities and understand the insights to learn their behaviour. The results of this thesis are machine learning models for a selected representative set of communities varying in size within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and a country model leveraging all data. These models are used for a regression task by predicting the lifetime of a user and a multi-label classification of a user into six different churn classes. Additionally, we have also given models for a binary classification, where the model will predict if the user will churn within a given time or not. These models have shown general strong predictive power, which is shrinking when limiting the observation time window. Especially the binary classification yielded high accuracy of over 99%. The best models have been used for predicting user churn within other communities to detect communities with possible similar behaviour. These similarities then have been determined by features' importance, where the most important features have got fed back into empirics. This has shown statistically significant differences between user groups with a different active time but as of today no clear trends were visible that had led us to define the communities' behaviours. Since the competition of social networks is still growing, the retaining of users will stay a core marketing strategy, which will need to be tackled by machine learning and artificial intelligence. The created models could be useful for predicting churning users within the platform Jodel to detect these customers that will churn within a given time. Researches did not focus much on anonymous and location-based messaging. That is why the results of this thesis on the anonymous messaging application Jodel opens a variety of possible tasks for the future in this context.",,"Bergmann, Max",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-6087,,OPUS4-6087,Bachelorarbeit
Promoting sustainability and resilience in Vietnam's floating community: the assessment of innovative housing units and materials for adaptation to climate change,,"Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st Century. According to the United Nations, Vietnam with a coastline of more than 3600 km, is one of top 30 countries facing an ""extremely high risk"" from the impacts of climate change over the next 30 years. Research undertaken in Vietnam indicates that significant impacts due to sea level rise have already occurred, resulting in the increased unpredictability and severity of coastal problems, such as land-loss, flooding of low lying coastal areas, accelerated coastal erosion, all which directly impacts the local population residing in the coastal region. Moreover, due to sea level rise, the amount of land available for development along the coast and further highly populated low lying land such as in the Mekong Delta will decrease. Facing these risks requires government and experts to urgently find effective solutions to ensure adequate space for residents in low-lying coastal areas. The current solutions being discussed are not only traditionally raising accommodation or resettlement to higher areas, or ""living with the water"", but also a view of ""living on the water"". In this case, floating architecture is seen as an effective solution for many low lying coastal areas all over the world and in Vietnam in particular. In fact that, Vietnam has a long history of floating settlements with a large number of floating villages. However, these floating villages are built with dilapidated houses which are built on rafts, and most floating settlements have been threaten by several socio-cultural, economic and environmental factors. Therefore, the main purpose of the research is to upgrade floating architecture in Vietnam to a higher level and standard adapting to climate change and social change. The research will provide methods and innovation tools to bridge the gap between existing floating house, as an unsafe and inconvenient type of accommodation, and contemporary housing needs in water bodies to allow for a fit between traditional designing experience and contemporary innovation of floating architecture. Based on lessons and innovations of floating architecture development in other countries, as well as based on the traditional experience and vernacular architecture of floating houses in Vietnam, the research will create theoretical frameworks, guidelines and design criteria for sustainable floating houses and floating settlements. The sustainable concept focuses on both sustainability and affordability when using innovative floating structures and materials in accordance with the local climatic and social condition of Vietnam, as well as adapting to climate change and sea level rise. The study will not only protect existing floating villages, preserve aquatic lifestyle that ensure a stable and permanent living on the water for inhabitants, but also improve floating architecture for modern demands and resilient living adapting to social change and climate change in Vietnam.",,"Nguyen, Thi Thu Trang",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5455,,OPUS4-5455,Dissertation
On implicit variables and related topics in mathematical optimization,,"This thesis is concerned with the phenomenon of implicit variables in optimization theory. Roughly speaking, a variable is called implicit whenever it is used to model the feasible set but does not appear in the objective function. At the first glance, such variables seem to be less relevant for the purpose of optimization. First, we provide a theoretical study on optimization problems with implicit variables. Therefore, we rely on a model program which covers several interesting problem classes from optimization theory such as bilevel optimization problems, evaluated multiobjective optimization problems, or optimization problems with cardinality constraints. We start our analysis by clarifying that the interpretation of implicit variables as explicit ones induces additional local minimizers. Afterwards, we study three reasonable stationarity systems of Mordukhovich-stationarity-type for the original problem as well as some comparatively weak associated constraint qualifications. The obtained results are applied to the three example classes mentioned above. Second, we introduce switching- and or-constrained optimization problems. Exploiting the observation that each or-constrained optimization problem can be transferred into a switching-constrained optimization problem with the aid of slack variables, one can interpret or-constrained programs as optimization problems comprising implicit variables. Necessary optimality conditions and constraint qualifications for both problem classes are derived. Furthermore, some approaches for the numerical solution of both problem classes are discussed and results of computational experiments are presented. The shortcomings of implicit variables are highlighted in terms of or-constrained optimization. Third, we study three different scenarios where optimality conditions and constraint qualifications for challenging optimization problems can be constructed while abstaining from the introduction of implicit variables. We start by deriving a generalized version of the linear independence constraint qualification as well as second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for so-called disjunctive optimization problems, which cover several interesting but inherently irregular problem classes like mathematical programs with complementarity, switching, or-, and cardinality constraints. Afterwards, we exploit several different single-level reformulations of standard bilevel optimization problems in order to find first- and second-order sufficient optimality conditions. Finally, we study sequential stationarity and regularity conditions for nonsmooth mathematical problems with generalized equation constraints with the aid of the popular limiting variational analysis. The investigated model problem covers the one we use for the theoretical analysis of implicit variables.",,"Mehlitz, Patrick",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5529,,OPUS4-5529,Habilitation
Development of a novel thermodynamic database for salt systems with potential as phase change materials,,"Research on energy saving technologies surged in the last decades. One especially relevant technology regards thermal energy storage via phase change materials, or PCM. These materials function as regenerative thermal batteries that can absorb and release thermal energy via the latent heat associated with a phase change, while temperature is kept constant. The advantage of this technology is that due to the latent heat effect the energy density is very high, which reduces the required size of the medium and makes it easier to be coupled with heat loss sources, both in industrial and household applications. The challenge lies, however, in identifying correct PCMs for specific operation temperatures. The goal of the thesis is, then, to develop a novel thermodynamic database that describes the thermodynamic properties of salt mixtures with potential as phase change materials, both for high (up to 800 &#8451;) and low temperature (up to 100 &#8451;) applications; and, then, to perform a screening to identify potential PCM compositions in the database. The database is created with FactSage, a Calphad software, and the systems covered are the anhydrous CaCl2-Ca(NO3)2-KCl-KNO3-NaCl-NaNO3, for high temperature PCMs, and the hydrated Mn(NO3)2-H2O, Zn(NO3)2-H2O, MgSO4-H2O and ZnSO4-H2O, for low temperature PCMs. The liquid solution in all systems is modelled with the non-ideal associates model and, therefore, no aqueous solution model is required. The experimental data used for the assessments come from the literature and from new measurements performed by the partners of the PCM-Screening project (FKZ 03ET1441). A new program called DataOptimizer has been developed to assist with the optimisation of thermodynamic databases. Relying on the ChemApp software and the NOMAD optimizer, DataOptimizer overcomes many shortcomings of similar database optimisation programs. A graphical user interface featuring a real-time plotting output is also implemented, which allows for a much easier and user-friendly experience. Details about the implementation and features of the program are given. Finally, the identification of PCM candidates is performed using both phase diagrams calculated with FactSage and a new numerical screening algorithm, which relies on ChemApp. The screening algorithm proves to be capable of identifying eutectics in multicomponent systems automatically without the need for phase diagrams. As a result, twenty-two PCM candidates are identified for high temperature applications within the anhydrous system and, fourteen candidates, for low temperature applications within the hydrated systems.",,"Reis, Bruno Henrique",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5590,,OPUS4-5590,Dissertation
PGAS for (in)coherent manycore systems,,"As the architectural walls drive the number of parallel cores in multicore systems up, it becomes harder to maintain cache coherence across all of the physical memory and all cores. On the other hand, even given a performant cache-coherent system, the unavoidable non-uniform memory (NUMA) and non-uniform cache (NUCA) architectures make programming for it difficult. A potential solution to this problem is to interpret massive multicore machines as a distributed system with remote memory access, and therefore, use existing distributed programming models. A natural fit for such an approach is the PGAS model, which provides a global address space divided into partitions that can be either local or remote. Unfortunately, completely discarding the notion of sharing ignores the efficient hardware mechanisms available in multicore machines with shared memory. This survey examines PGAS frameworks and communication libraries with an focus on the PGAS model to enable PGAS applications to exploit shared memory in massive multicore machines without sacrificing the benefits of the PGAS programming model.",,"Kuban, Robert",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5618,,OPUS4-5618,Bericht
Methods of evaluation and improvement on cascaded wired and wireless real-time communication networks for factory automation,,"Factory automation applications require a communication system that concurrently supports them with determinism, reliability, short communication cycles, and precise synchronization as well as mobility and extensibility. However, neither currently employed wired nor available wireless communication networks support all of these requirements at once. On the one hand, wired networks lack mobility and extensibility. On the other hand, wireless networks do not support reliability or determinism due to the stochastic nature of wireless channels. Moreover, none of the available wireless networks enable transmission latencies of 1 ms and below. Therefore, they cannot support the required short communication cycles. However, various research initiatives and the currently developed 5G standard promise to overcome these limitations at least partially. Nevertheless, even a corresponding wireless network will not directly replace all wired connections, but will initially be used for subsections of the data transmission, where e.g. mobility is of utmost importance. Accordingly, cascaded communication networks consisting of hierarchically ordered, wired and wireless subnetworks will emerge. In this thesis, we investigate effects and dependencies of such a cascading for the real-time communication of factory automation applications. Therefore, we have to find methods to interconnect arbitrary wired and wireless communication networks such that we can maintain the reliable real-time performance of wired subnetworks and the mobility of wireless subnetworks without, or at most with minimal performance degradation. Ideally, with a cascaded network, no hardware or software adjustments will be necessary compared to the individual networks deployed today. Based on a delimiting review of different application areas and a dedicated use case analysis of typical factory automation applications, we derive the most challenging requirements that have to be fulfilled by cascaded communication networks. According to this review, we present several methods to reduce the overall transmission latency in cascaded networks. Starting with analyzing different interface concepts and continuing with frame conversion methods, we achieve a decision-making basis to select dedicated subnetworks for a cascaded network that can be used for closed-loop control applications. Additionally, we develop methods to optimize the parametrization of individual subnetworks with respect to the overall communication, such that the end-to-end transmission latency can be drastically reduced. For verification, we design a generic model for analyzing the timing behavior of arbitrary communication networks and verify it based on an analysis of a machine tool application scenario. Additional measurements based on a real demonstrator implementation corroborate that, in industrial application, cascaded communication networks can provide competitive performance compared to the currently used wired networks.",,"Dietrich, Steven",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5483,,OPUS4-5483,Dissertation
Permittivity biosensor for the recognition of saliva samples of COPD patients using neuromorphic-based machine learning,,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung disease, causing breathing difficulties in patients due to obstructed airflow in lungs. COPD is one of the main leading causes of death worldwide with an annual mortality rate of three million people. Despite the absence of an effective treatment for COPD, an early-stage diagnosis plays a crucial role for the effective management of the disease. However, majority of patients with objective COPD go undiagnosed until late stages of their disease due to the lack of a reliable technology for the recognition and monitoring of COPD in Point-of-Care (PoC). Alternative diagnostic approaches such as the accurate examination of respiratory tract fluids like saliva can address this issue using a portable biosensor in a home-care environment. Nonetheless, the accurate diagnosis of COPD based on this approach is only possible by concurrent consideration of patients demographic--medical parameters. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) tools are necessary for the comprehensive recognition of COPD in a PoC setting. On the other hand, drawbacks of cloud-based ML techniques for medical applications such as data safety, immerse energy consumption, and enormous computation requirements need to be addressed for this application. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to develop a ML-equipped system for the management of COPD in a PoC setup. A portable permittivity biosensor was developed in this work and its in-vitro performance was evaluated throughout clinical experiments. ML techniques were applied on biosensor results, demonstrating the significant role of these algorithms for the recognition of COPD. Moreover, developed ML models were deployed on a neuromorphic platform for addressing the shortcomings of cloud-based approaches.",,"Soltani Zarrin, Pouya",2021,,,OPUS4-5501,Dissertation
Efficient time integration methods for linear parabolic partial differential equations with applications,,"In this thesis we study efficient time integration methods for linear parabolic PDEs to solve practical problems that arise in a variety of real-world applications. The classical construction of numerical methods for solving PDEs is based on the method of lines, which leads to a large sparse semi-discretised system of ODEs to which any numerical method for initial value ODE problems can be applied. When dealing with parabolic-type problems, the underlying ODE systems are known to be stiff. Therefore, in the context of linear model problems, the use of implicit schemes is usually considered to be the best choice in practice. However, this statement is not correct for some relevant real-world applications. In particular, implicit schemes can cause high computational costs that are equipped with certain model conditions. The model problems considered here are coupled with various settings, ranging from many different initial conditions over long-term simulation with relatively frequent model updates, to dealing with very large-scale problems for which the matrix size can exceed several millions. For this reason, we are interested in sophisticated and computationally efficient numerical methods that bring the aspects of approximation accuracy as well as computational and storage complexity into balance. Even nowadays it is still a challenging task to devise a numerical method that combines high accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency for the model problem to be solved. Therefore, the main objective is to find an easy and efficient ODE integration scheme for each individual model problem. On this basis, we first give a comprehensive introduction to the state-of-the-art methods that are often used for practical purposes. In this framework, we will investigate very detailed the theoretical and numerical foundations of two popular techniques, namely the fast explicit methods and the model order reduction techniques. This is primarily important in order to fully understand the numerical methods, and also absolutely essential in finding the best numerical method that is specifically suitable for the intended purpose. Our second goal is then to efficiently solve the practical problems that arise in connection with shape correspondence, geothermal energy storage and image osmosis filtering. For each application we specify a complete setup, and in order to provide an efficient and accurate numerical approximation, we give a thorough discussion of the various numerical solvers along with many technical details and own adaptations. We validate our numerical findings through many experiments using synthetic and real-world data. In addition, the thesis provides a complete and detailed description of the powerful methods that can be very useful for tackling similar problems that are the subject of interest in many applications.",,"Bähr, Martin",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5753,,OPUS4-5753,Dissertation
Modeling and simulation of thermo-electro hydrodynamics,,"The GeoFlow (Geophysical Flow) experiment on the International Space Station (ISS) and the AtmoFlow (Atmospherical Flow) experiment are designed to study convective processes under microgravity conditions in the spherical gap geometry. By applying a high voltage field between two concentric spherical shells and utilizing a dielectric working fluid it is possible to maintain an artificial radial force field that is comparable to a planetary gravitational field. This makes it possible to study convection such as known from the Earth's outer core, the Earth's mantle, or planetary atmospheres. The radial force field is based on the dielectrophoretic effect and is described by thermo-electro hydrodynamics (TEHD). This habilitation thesis presents a comprehensive view on modeling TEHD and the numerical simulation of the governing equations with a focus on GeoFlow and AtmoFlow. The GeoFlow experiment investigated thermal convection with and without dielectric (internal) heating under long-time micro-gravity conditions on the ISS. This unique experimental setup consisted of a bottom heated and top cooled spherical gap, filled with the silicon oil M5 or 1-Nonanol. Rotation, varying voltage, and temperature differences across the gap could be applied, to spread the experimental parameter space. The main focus of GeoFlow was the investigation of flow properties such as the convective onset, the transition from laminar to turbulent flows, and the influence of rotation on convection. Experimental outcomes were compared with theoretical and numerical results via advanced post-processing techniques. This includes pattern recognition algorithms and statistical evaluation of the numerical simulations. The TEHD model was validated on the onset of convection through linear stability analysis, on properties of columnar cells and global convective structures such as regular laminar flows. It is shown that TEHD based convection is comparable with Rayleigh-Benard convection and that is can be described by the quasi-normal approximation. For rotating cases and low super-criticalities the Proudman-Taylor theorem dominated the fluid flow which resulted in global columnar cells. In summary, the presented TEHD model is able to explain certain aspects of convective flows observed in GeoFlow. It is the first validation for such a model at all stages. The AtmoFlow experiment is based on GeoFlow but is designed to investigate global cells and planetary waves which are known from planetary atmospheres. Its unique feature are the atmospheric-like boundary conditions. Understanding the interaction between atmospheric circulation and a planet's climate, be it Earth, Mars, Jupiter, or a distant exoplanet, contributes to various fields of research such as astrophysics, geophysics, fluid physics, and climatology. AtmoFlow is currently under construction and is planned for operation on the ISS in 2024.",,"Zaussinger, Florian",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5517,,OPUS4-5517,Habilitation
Experimental investigation of turbulent boundary layer with uniform blowing at moderate and high Reynolds numbers,,"Experimental investigation in turbulent boundary layer flows represents one of the canonical geometries of wall bounded shear flows. Utmost relevance of such experiments, however, is applied in the engineering applications in aerospace and marine industries. In particular, continuous effort is being imparted to explore the underlying physics of the flow in order to develop models for numerical tools and to achieve flow control. Within the scope of this Ph. D. topic, application of active control method such as micro-blowing effect in the incompressible, zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer was investigated. Turbulent boundary layer flow is particularly interesting as well as challenging due to the presence of different interacting scales which are increasingly becoming significant as the flow inertial conditions keeps growing. Therefore, energy content of the coherent structures in outer layer becomes stronger and necessitates measurements in relatively large Reynolds number. Present control experiments in turbulent boundary layer can be split into two different work segments, where one is objected towards the data measurements in turbulent boundary layer over smooth surface with and without any external perturbation. Here, perturbation is applied in the form of wall normal blowing while keeping the magnitude of blowing very low compared to the free stream velocity. For the subsequent results reported here, magnitude of blowing ratio was varied between 0%~6%. In the first part of the present thesis e.g. 0.415×10e+3&#8804;Re&#964;&#8804;1.160×10e+3, measurements were performed at the Brandenburg University of Technology wind tunnel. Non-intrusive Laser Doppler Anemometry was applied to carry out a series of measurements on a zero pressure gradient flat plate turbulent boundary layer. Blowing ratio through the perforated surface was varied between 0.17%~1.52% of the free stream velocity. To a maximum of 50% reduction in friction drag was achieved. For the measurements on the upper range of the stated Reynolds number, were conducted at the boundary layer wind tunnel. This boundary layer wind tunnel offers a spatially developed turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate within 2.2×10e+3&#8804;Re&#964;&#8804;5.5×10e+3 with an excellent spatial resolution. With the help of Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry technique, measurement of the velocity components were obtained covering entire boundary layer in streamwise wall normal plane. In addition, time resolved measurements were also obtained in spanwise and wall-normal plane in order to look into the morphology of turbulent structures immediately above the blowing area.",,"Hasanuzzaman, Gazi",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5566,,OPUS4-5566,Dissertation
Investigating and modeling the effect of metal forming-related measures for damage-controlled hot forming,,"Within the process chains of the semi-finished production, hot forming is used to eliminate pores and voids from the casting process under compressive stresses and to adjust the microstructure for further processing. In the case of caliber rolling process, tensile stresses occur at certain roll gap ratios which promote void formation (damage) on non-metallic inclusion. Decohesion of matrix and inclusion in void formation is determined by local flow stress. Since the process is carried out above recrystallization temperature, damage cannot only be controlled through stress state (stress triaxiality and Lode parameter) but also the softening processes like dynamic recovery (DRV) and recrystallization (DRX) which can relieve local stresses. Such processes can be used to delay or prevent the damage initiation and growth and hence the mechanical properties of components can be improved. In spite of this, the influence of DRX on damage development has not been quantified so far. This study focuses on the understanding the interaction between softening processes and damage during hot forming and to derive a model for coupled microstructure and damage evolution. For precise damage modeling, in-depth damage characterization of the specimens deformed during hot tensile tests under different stress states and deformation conditions (temperature and strain rate) is conducted. The stress states are varied by designing the specimens with different notch radii. To model the influence of local stresses on damage, continuum-based damage modeling approach is adapted where a system of matrix-inclusion-interface is considered. The influence of different parameters such as DRX, stress state, temperature, strain rate, total strain, inclusion size and type (soft/hard) is analyzed. Based on the damage quantification results, an extension to Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) damage model is devised where a new nucleation criterion couples the stress state and DRX to the void formation at inclusions. The extended GTN model is utilized to predict the internal damage during multi-step hot caliber rolling process and validated with experimentally observed damage at different locations of stress state and recrystallized volume fraction. Based on the model, a damage-controlled strategy is proposed by finding the solution of optimal control problem (OCP) to obtain an optimal variable deformation speed that can induce low damage as compared to constant speed while keeping the process time constant. To implement the damage-controlled strategy, an isothermal forming simulator is designed and manufactured that can replicate the real load paths during hot forming. It is suggested that damage can be controlled if material is allowed to recrystallize at low deformation speed without inducing damage and then, speed up the deformation after onset of recrystallization.",,"Imran, Muhammad",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5710,,OPUS4-5710,Dissertation
The lateral photovoltage scanning method to probe spatial inhomogeneities in semiconductors: a joined numerical and experimental investigation,,"The Lateral-Photovoltage-Scanning-Method (LPS) operates well for Si, Ge and Si_{1-x}-Ge_x for an analysis in defect regions below one part per million, where Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) or X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) signals fall below its detection limit. Although LPS is well established since 1999, it is still poorly investigated. We used a computational simulation finite volume (FVM) approach, solving the van-Roosbroeck equations in three dimensions using a MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver MUMPS. The signal transport is simulated by solving the Maxwell equations in two dimension for different sample geometries. It could be shown that a typical LPS-measurement is distorted due to the samples geometry (except cuboid). This distortion can be simulated, understood and recalculated, as discussed for trapezoidal or cylindrical samples. Also using the signal generation simulation of this measurement technique it can be shown, that the measurement signal is convoluted depending on the inherent minority charge carrier life time reducing the local resolution. An investigation of the local resolution were made using a Gaussian function as the convolution function of this method. A comparison of simulations to real measurements was discussed on silicon samples with boron implantation pattern. In 1955 Tauc already stated that the bulk photovoltaic effect, causative for the LPS measurement set-up, could be used detecting any quantity, which affects the band structure of a semiconductor.As strain is coupled to the conduction and valence band profiles by the deformation potential theory by van-de-Walle, we investigated the possibility to detect strain variations using LPS simulations. For an n-type Si sample with an on-top stressor stripe (silicon-nitride) the strain distribution in Si got calculated by finite elemente simulation (FEM) using solid mechanics module. By directly converting the strain profile to a single conduction and valence band, FVM LPS simulations were performed. It could be shown, that the LPS voltage can be connected to hole traps caused by the conduction and valence band profile. Therefore we can finally conclude, that the LPS measurement set-up is suitable measuring conduction and valence band variations caused by strain.",,"Kayser, Stefan",2021,,,OPUS4-5435,Dissertation
"Solving high-dimensional PDEs, approximation of path space measures and importance sampling of diffusions",,"Motivated by computing functionals of high-dimensional, potentially metastable diffusion processes, this thesis studies robustness issues appearing in the numerical approximation of expectation values and their gradients. A major challenge being high variances of corresponding estimators, we investigate importance sampling of stochastic processes for improving statistical properties and provide novel nonasymptotic bounds on the relative error of corresponding estimators depending on deviations from optimality. Numerical strategies that aim to come close to those optimal sampling strategies can be encompassed in the framework of path space measures, and minimizing suitable divergences between those measures suggests a variational formulation that can be addressed in the spirit of machine learning. A key observation is that while several natural choices of divergences have the same unique minimizer, their finite sample properties differ vastly. We provide the novel log-variance divergence, which turns out to have favorable robustness properties that we investigate theoretically and apply in the context of path space measures as well as in the context of densities, for instance offering promising applications in Bayesian variational inference. Aiming for optimal importance sampling of diffusions is (more or less) equivalent to solving Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman PDEs and it turns out that our numerical methods can be equally applied for the approximation of rather general high-dimensional semi-linear PDEs. Motivated by stochastic representations of elliptic and parabolic boundary value problems we refine variational methods based on backward SDEs and provide the novel diffusion loss, which can be related to other state-of-the-art attempts, while offering certain numerical advantages.",,"Richter, Lorenz",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5864,,OPUS4-5864,Dissertation
Projecting motion capture : designing and implementing a modular and flexible facial animation pipeline to evaluate different perceptual effects,,"We can not not communicate, humans use body language and facial expressions to communicate verbally and non-verbally with others. Humans are experts at deciphering and understanding facial expressions. Thus, synthesizing them on a virtual face becomes a very challenging task. Realistic facial animations have various applications like movies, games or affective interfaces. Often motion capture recordings of real humans are used to provide the virtual face with realistic motion. Animation controls need to be established to transfer the captured motion onto the virtual face. To mimic the full essence of the captured motion, these animation controls need to be carefully planned beforehand which is accompanied with high effort in terms of spent time and money. The presented thesis would like to offer an alternative approach to the common performance-driven facial animation techniques. Instead of using motion capture to drive a pre-defined blend-shape rig, this thesis projects motion capture directly onto a facial mesh. Throughout the proposed pipeline, different methods for retargeting, rigging and skinning are evaluated. Special attention is given to the fact that the origin of motion capture and the appearance of the virtual face does not need to be identical. A constraint for this approach to work is clean motion capture data. For that, this thesis offers an automatic way to clean facial motion trajectories and establishes stable and coherent motion curves. To not just give insights about the capability of the proposed pipeline but also to provide valuable results in the field of perception of virtual avatars, perceptual experiments are conducted. These experiments reveal the functionality of the pipeline and show that it is possible to re-use motion capture on different virtual faces. Additionally, the proposed pipeline is used as a tool to investigate into the perception of non-verbal communication for virtual avatars.",,"Legde, Katharina",2021,10.26127/BTUOpen-5604,,OPUS4-5604,Dissertation
Mining in the context of African World Heritage cultural landscapes : an assessment of management planning effectiveness,,"Sub-Saharan African cultural landscapes are adversely impacted by various development pressures, which calls for a holistic and integrated approach in their management. Mining development has been ranked highly by UNESCO World Heritage Centre, as one of the most common factors threatening the conservation and management of World Heritage properties around the world. For instance, out of 141 World Heritage properties which submitted their state of conservation reports in 2015, 18% were affected by mining activities. Out of these, 84% of the properties that were threatened by mining development were either cultural landscapes, natural properties and or mixed properties. African World Heritage cultural landscapes are the ones highly affected and threatened by planned and on-going mining and exploration activities. Therefore, research was carried out using the Mulanje Mountain Cultural Landscape of Malawi and Mapungubwe Cultural landscape of South Africa. Specifically, the study aimed at examining the existing cultural landscape management theories and concepts in order to understand the key elements to be integrated into the suggested strategic management planning methodological framework. It also aimed at evaluating the impact of mining development on the conservation and management of African cultural landscapes. The study also investigated the stakeholder's views and perception about the impact of mining activities on cultural and natural heritage values of the landscapes. To achieve the research objectives, the literature was reviewed, firstly to determine the dimensions of cultural landscapes, and secondly, to determine the dimensions of mining development in World Heritage cultural landscapes. The study used two case studies as an effective comparative research strategy in the investigation of the conflicting issues of mining development against the conservation of the attributes of the two cultural landscapes. A case study research strategy was combined with other research methodologies. These included interviews, focus-group-discussions, observations, field site surveys, qualitative content analysis, and thematic analysis. The study has revealed that stakeholder participation and inclusion is a key element in the integration of mining development in cultural landscape planning. This research has contributed to the methodological gap in cultural landscape management planning by developing and applying an integrated strategic management planning methodological framework. The application of this framework has shown that the governance in place for Mulanje Mountain cultural landscape conformed to the requirements of a long-term and holistic planning process and the participation and empowerment of multiple stakeholders in that process.",,"Malijani, Oris Chapinga",2020,,,OPUS4-5633,Dissertation
District heating in Lusatia : status quo and prospects for climate neutrality,,"The master thesis at hand examines the potential of district heating in Lusatia. The thesis follows the approach of first identifying technical and economic potentials in general and then transferring them to the study region. For the quantitative determination of district heating potential in Lusatia, the status quo is determined and a GIS-based analysis is carried out with regard to minimum heat demand densities. The extent to which district heating is suitable for climate-neutral heat supply will be investigated using the potential of renewable and waste heat energy sources. Furthermore, the regional economic effects of developing these potentials are examined. The results show that despite an overall decline in heat demand, there is potential to increase the relative share of district heating in Lusatia. In terms of climate neutrality, district heating in Lusatia offers special opportunities. Solar thermal energy and Power-to-Heat are of particular importance due to the rural character of Lusatia and its status as an energy region. From a regional economic perspective, climate-neutral district heating has a positive effect on value added and employment.",,"Bahnsen, Jan Christian",2020,,,OPUS4-5602,Masterarbeit / Diplomarbeit
"Synthesis and characterization of layered transition metal trihalides MCl&#8323; (M = Ru, Mo, Ti, Cr) and CrX&#8323; (X = Cl, Br, I)",,"The investigation of novel structure-to-property relations of many transition metal trihalides MX&#8323; by downscaling to promising monolayer is still pending. However, the production of two-dimensional MX&#8323; sheets that are both high crystalline and thin is an experimental challenge. This thesis is focused on the rational synthesis planning and the derived targeted preparation of thin MX&#8323; nanosheets (&#8804; 100 nm) on suitable substrates by chemical vapor transport (CVT) as well as their characterization by complementary analytical methods. CVT of nanosheets directly on substrates benefits of low timescales, less material consumption and only few structural distortions. For the determination of optimal growth conditions, the CVT processes of investigated compounds were initially simulated by using the Calphad method (program package TRAGMIN). Thus, the occurring transport efficient gas species and temperature dependent, dominating vapor transport equilibria were calculated to optimize the growth process in a direct and straightforward way. Based on prior simulation results single crystalline sheets of MCl&#8323; (M = Ru, Mo, Ti, Cr) and CrX&#8323; (X = I, Br, Cl) were successfully prepared at temperatures between 573 - 1023 K on YSZ (yttrium stabilized zirconia) or sapphire substrates. The adjustable CVT parameters (transport duration, temperatures or weighed starting material) were optimized with respect to the targeted synthesis of either bulk or nanosheets at substrates. Microsheets with thicknesses of less than 4 &#956;m (&#945;-TiCl&#8323;) and about 20 nm thin nanosheets (&#945;-RuCl&#8323;, CrCl&#8323; and CrI&#8323;) down to ultrathin flakes (&#8776; 3 nm, &#945;-MoCl&#8323; and CrBr&#8323;) were obtained by CVT. As a highlight, monolayers of &#945;-RuCl&#8323; and CrCl&#8323; were isolated successfully by means of a subsequent delamination. The MX&#8323; sheets morphology and dimension was described by optical and electron microscopy, highlighting their two-dimensional nature. By several X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction techniques the desired composition (M:X = 1:3), high crystallinity and phase-purity of thick and thin MX&#8323; platelets was confirmed subsequently. With respect to MX&#8323; nanosheets a slight increase (&#945;-RuCl&#8323;, &#945;-MoCl&#8323; and CrBr&#8323;) or decrease (CrCl&#8323;) in phonon energies was observed in comparison to their bulk counterparts. The magnetic properties of CrCl&#8323; micro- and nanosheets were determined to be solely ferromagnetic and thus different than those of the bulk samples. Finally, the structure-to-property relations were investigated at a first example. The catalytic properties of &#945;-TiCl&#8323; microsheets were investigated by gas-phase polymerization of ethylene. By downscaling the catalysts thickness by CVT, we obtained an activity improvement of 24 % in comparison to bulk &#945;-TiCl&#8323;.",,"Grönke, Martin",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5282,,OPUS4-5282,Dissertation
Application of the One-Dimensional Turbulence model to electrohydrodynamically enhanced internally forced convective flows,,"This thesis is an attempt to assess some of the effects that electroquasistatic body forces exert on turbulent internally forced convective flows. In order to do that, a stochastic turbulence model is employed, namely, the One-Dimensional Turbulence (ODT) model. The reduced dimensionality of ODT demands a reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations (and in this case, also the Maxwell equations), into a 1-D system. This is done by performing an asymptotic analysis in terms of the nondimensional numbers of the flow. Also, a validation step due to the relative novel character of the cylindrical ODT formulation is done for an incompressible and constant properties flow regime and a variable density flow regime. The validation is presented for both the temporal (T-ODT) and a novel spatial (S-ODT) formulation in both planar and cylindrical geometries. Results in the constant property case show that wall normal (and radial) profiles, in both the T-ODT and S-ODT formulations, show good agreement with each other and to the data of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNSs). For the evaluated variable density heated pipe flow, gradients at the wall can be better reproduced with S-ODT. After validating the model, ODT is applied first into a planar configuration which emulates the flow in a wire-plate Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP). For this flow, the additional input energy due to the electroquasistatic body force has an effect on the modification of the bulk velocity, and subsequently, the skin friction coefficient. Some qualitative DNS trends are confirmed with ODT, such as the localized increase of the Reynolds stress, as a consequence of increased eddy activity close to the discharge electrodes. Next, the results of ODT simulations in a cylindrical wire-tube ESP are presented. Here, ODT results are compared to experimental results. ODT results for global integral quantities such as the streamwise pressure gradient and the Nusselt number enhancement ratio are able to match in a reasonable way the experimental results. The competing relevance between the EHD contribution to turbulence by momentum, and by affecting the temperature and density due to the Joule heating effect is also analyzed, showing the leading order relevance of the former one. Specifically for the Nusselt number results, the sensitivity of the EHD flow to transition effects is shown to be very significant. This thesis may open the door to a vast new field of phenomena which can not only serve for the further validation of the ODT model against DNSs or experiments, but also for the real use of ODT in applications which are so far inaccessible for traditional DNSs.",,"Medina Mendez, Juan Ali",2020,,,OPUS4-5338,Dissertation
A new analytical design method of ultra-low-noise voltage controlled VHF crystal oscillators and it's validation,,"The design of high Q oscillators, using Crystals at lower frequencies, (and dielectric resonators at much higher frequencies), has long been considered a black art. This may be due to the fact that a systematic approach with optimized design guideline for crystal oscillators could not be found after extensive literature search. In this dissertation, after analyzing the first crystal oscillator by W.G. Cady (1921), other high performance crystal oscillators will be discussed, analyzed and calculated. A single transistor crystal oscillator design as used by HP (Hewlett Packard) in one of their designs, the HP10811A is considered in this thesis for mathematical analysis and CAD (Computer aided Design) simulation. This was also measured on state-of-the-art signal source analyzer. After validation, this design is scaled to 100MHz, the frequency of interest for this dissertation. Though most designers use a single transistor based oscillator circuit, it is not an optimized design because of limited control over key design parameters such as loop gain, dc current etc. This dissertation is an attempt to overcome the limitation due to the single transistor circuit and to give a step by step procedure, explaining the significance of a two transistor design with thorough analysis and design simulation results. This two stage transistor circuit is also not yet a best solution in terms of phase noise performance and output power, and some add-on circuitry will be needed for an optimized performance. An important contribution of this work is to show that since the voltage gain is the ratio of the collector resistor and the emitter resistor, the performance is practically independent of the VHF transistor and gives better control over various parameters of the oscillator, in order to optimize the design. A grounded-base amplifier is then introduced and added for improving the isolation and the output power. Unlike most oscillators, that take the output from the collector, a novel concept introduced by Rohde [14], is incorporated here, where the crystal is used as a filter that is then connected to the grounded base amplifier, a technique which many companies have been using. This dissertation will show that this technique increases the output power without significantly affecting the phase noise. Such a validation is needed for better understanding and as per my knowledge, has not been done so far. For the oscillator, the tuning diode sensitivity and flicker noise contribution are also taken into consideration, by calibrating the mathematics and its validation is shown. Crystal resonators of the type AT and stress-compensated (SC) cut devices will be considered as they give the best performance. The one port Colpitts type oscillator is considered first and the two port two transistor design later. Both will need a post amplifier/buffer stage. A complete step by step design procedure for an optimized 100MHz crystal oscillator is then presented. For completeness, CAD Simulation and Experimental results are provided for 10 MHz, 128 MHz and 155 MHz VCO circuits.",,"Apte, Anisha",2020,,,OPUS4-5138,Dissertation
Studies on the influence of mechanical stress on the properties of silicon sensor modules for the ATLAS Phase-II Upgrade,,"The subject of this thesis is the development and test of silicon strip detectors for the high luminosity upgrade of the tracking detector of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Special emphasis is devoted to the understanding of the impact of mechanical stress on the electrical properties and the particle detection performance of detector modules. First simulations were done to estimate the maximum expected stress on a sensor when operated at -30 °C within the future silicon strip tracking detector ITk, at ATLAS. The maximum stress in a worst case scenario is expected to be 27 MPa. Tensile strength tests were done to estimate the maximum stress which can be applied to a silicon strip sensor. Silicon shards, with a thickness and dopand concentration corresponding to the ITk sensor specifications break at >23 MPa, wafers at >700 MPa and sensors at ~ 400 MPa. The huge variations lead to the assumption, that the tensile stregth, which is highly dependent on the quality of the crystal lattice, is due to different cutting technology. Wafers, irradiated with a fluence equivalent of a lifetime dose of an ITk sensor, show no stress dependency of the youngs modulus. The tensile strength of irradiated wafers is decreased by ~ 6,6 %. No damage on silicon sensors from mechanical stress is expected for sensor modules installed it the ITk. The electrical properties of silicon strip sensors were studied for applied mechanical stress on ATLAS07 sensors up to 60 MPa. The specifications of the sensors are similar to the specification of strip sensors in the future silicon strip tracker barrel region of the ATLAS detector. The leakage current changes at 50 MPa by -1.7 %, the bias resistance by +0.8 % and the interstrip resistance by -25 %. The depletion voltage and the implant resistance are not affected by mechanical stress. Except for the interstrip resistance the results can be explained by piezoresistive effects. Silicon strip modules were build and studied in particle test beams. These modules consists of an ATLAS07 or an ATLAS12 sensor and an analogue readout to study the influence of stress on the module performance. The sensor module noise is independent from the applied stress. An effect of stress on the signal strength was seen. The ATLAS07 sensor module signal strength was decreased and the ATLAS12 sensor module signal strength was increased with a slope of ~0,6 MPa^-1. The average cluster size of the ATLAS07 sensor module was increased by 0,25 % MPa^-1 and the average cluster size of the ATLAS12 sensor module was decreased by 0,06 % MPa^-1 with applied stress.",,"Stegler, Martin",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5323,,OPUS4-5323,Dissertation
Hidden in plain sight : the topography of prostitution in Florence between 1860 and 1888,,"Architectural conservation is conventionally associated with preservation of buildings or ensembles that were seats of religious or secular power marking great architectural, political, or scientific accomplishments. Dark and difficult heritage concerns events of disasters, extermination, and war. But what happens to stories and their places that do not fit into any of these categories? They are neither grand or beautiful, nor explicitly traumatic but nonetheless they embed cultural values and norms, or perhaps even the opposite of them: the bordellos and the marginalised groups of society that are usually disregarded in heritage discourses. The question of sex work in contemporary culture holds an important place, as it is connected to social and economic rights of women. Historic sex work, and the places associated with it, imbed in this sense a contention value, because still today it provokes debate among different interest groups. This research work presents the first in-depth study into the location of Florentine bordellos and sex workers between 1860 and 1888. It was a central moment in the history of these women and their trade because a new regulation on sex work was introduced by the recently unified Italian state which spatially controlled the sex trade. Each bordello and the sex workers came under intense scrutiny of the law. What was a dramatic development in the life of these women at the time, has allowed for extensive historical analysis. The research draws primarily from over 5,000 archived police files and examines the location of sex trade in relation to the legal framework provided by the regulation known as the Regolamento Cavour. It was to ensure that sex workers would not pass on any venereal disease, while, at the same time, strived to maintain moral order in a continuously growing city, faced with urban development. In addition, the historic spatial development of bordellos within the perimeter of the ancient city walls was studied as well as the economic and political factors which influenced the position of a bordello within the urban fabric. For that purpose, the study incorporated information from historic city and street directories as well as cadastre maps. These different layers of information are conveyed in numerous maps to visualise the spatial context of and relation between sex work and spaces.",,"Skedzuhn-Safir, Alexandra",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5200,,OPUS4-5200,Buch (Monographie)
Perspectives for Aleppo: towards an integrated approach for 'post- conflict' reconstruction of cultural heritage,,"The rebuilding of war-damaged historic cities has a significant impact on the way the affected societies can heal and recover in the post-conflict situation. If carried out without taking into consideration the inseparable relationship between the built structures and the formation of people's identity, the reconstruction processes could cause more damage than the one endured due to the conflict. In this context, the rebuilding of cities and their historic centres in particular play a significant role in restoring the collective memory of the shared setting. This dissertation researches the disturbing effects and trauma resulting from the deliberate destruction of heritage assets during armed conflicts, concerning both inhabitants and ancient urban structures. It discusses the discourse on the issue of post-conflict reconstruction that includes the arguments and recommendations made by several international experts and organizations which stipulates with both theoretical and practical outcome. The work of many theorists, authors, architects, philosophers, and professionals working in the field of heritage management, is examined thoroughly to provide a deep understanding of the issues discussed throughout this research. The most recent illustration within this context is the war in Syria, which has caused excessive damage to the country's cultural heritage. Noting that the military clashes have come to an end in several areas within the country and the physical damage has stopped, reconstruction projects have begun to materialize, and the urgent need for an overall consistent framework for rebuilding Syria is more crucial than ever. Syria's cultural heritage is facing a high threat of a second destruction, which will most likely follow if the involved governmental representatives, stakeholders, society or 'societies' did not realize the fundamental necessity for a value-based reconstruction approach which guarantees that the assessment of values is carried out and achieved in a balanced manner. Otherwise, mistakes will occur, and consequently, the collective memory and identity of the Syrians might never be recovered. The rebuilding of post-war Syria is complex and challenging; it embraces more than a physical transformation of urban structures, and poses new threats to achieve psychological healing and recovering. The urban integrity of the Syrian cities is threatened, especially in the old city of Aleppo where the damage goes beyond the physical fabric and extends to endanger the city's historical identity. Therefore, the main focus of the work is to develop a strategic framework which goes hand in hand with the traditional rebuilding approaches, and merges several practical and theoretical contexts deduced from previous case studies. The essence of the research revolves around understanding the significance of the city's heritage and historic fabric, which must be considered a priority when deciding for the reconstruction procedures.",,"Ibold, Nura",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5175,,OPUS4-5175,Dissertation
"Make-or-Buy: Should nature conservation agencies buy land and perform conservation activities on their own behalves, or should they pay farmers for voluntarily performing conservation activities?",,"Anthropogenic threat for the world's environment and ecosystems and financial constraints necessitate a wise use of resources for the implementation of biodiversity conservation measures. A cost-effective planning and governance of biodiversity conservation has to be done to achieve maximal ecological outcomes with given financial resources. A better understanding of available modes of governance can help to improve the cost-effectiveness of biodiversity conservation planning and implementation. This thesis investigates the influence of governance mode choice on the cost-effectiveness for biodiversity conservation measure implementation in selected conceptual and empirical settings, and identifies ecological, economic and climatic factors of influence. Linking the cost-effectiveness analysis for biodiversity conservation measures to the make-or-buy decision enables a novel perspective on cost-effective biodiversity conservation. In this context, conservation agencies are assumed to have two main options to implement biodiversity conservation measures in principle: (1) the buy alternative in which land is purchased for the purpose of biodiversity conservation measure implementation, and (2) the compensation alternative where a conservation agency compensates landowner's opportunity costs to incentivise voluntary conservation measure implementation by landowners. Two conceptual ecological-economic models were developed to analyse the cost-effective governance mode choice and their sensitivity to changing ecological, economic and climatic parameters. Two empirical case studies were conducted to address the question of cost-effective governance mode choice for a conservation project in Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) and a federal state wide comparison of conservation activities in California (USA). It was found that the buy alternative is more cost-effective than the compensation alternative if conservation budgets and interest are high. In addition, not only the choice of governance mode is relevant with respect to cost-effectiveness, but also the mechanism to spatially select conservation sites chosen within a selected governance mode. Changing climate change speed - among other factors - influences the cost-effectiveness of governance modes and site selection strategies. The cost-effective governance mode choice also crucially depends on the intended timeframe of a conservation project. For shorter timeframes, compensating landowners is the cost-effective governance mode, however for longer durations the buy alternative becomes more cost-effective. This effect arises specifically due high one-off costs for buying land, which however amortize over time, compared to high recurring costs for compensating landowners. Based on these findings, the policy recommendations are provided which aim to improve the cost-effectiveness of governance modes available for biodiversity conservation.",,"Schöttker, Oliver",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5271,,OPUS4-5271,Dissertation
Heritage and continuity in the bazaar,,"Tehran Bazaar has been the most influential marketplace in Iran, over the last two hundred years, since Tehran became the capital of the country. The Bazaar has been a significant socio-political agent in Iranian society. Nevertheless, less attention has been given to its internal atmosphere, where the bazaaris, have tried to conserve their traditions and preserve their heritage. One of these heritages are ""hey'ats"", religious formations for holding mourning sessions in Muharram month, as a ritual in Shi'a Islam. ""Hey'ats"" give the guilds a sense of collective identity, they represent them, and also build a shared heritage for them. The Drapers' Guild was the first guild in Tehran Bazaar, founding a hey'at. They founded this hey'at in 1883 and named it ""the Drapers' Hey'at"". After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the Drapers faced difficulties preserving their heritage. They were forced to displace the Mirza Mousa Mosque in the Bazaar. The Mosque was their center for holding religious sessions and was publicly known as ""the Drapers' Mosque"". Since they were attached to the Mosque, their displacement was perceived a loss of heritage. Later, they decided to build a new home, ""the Drapers' Hosseinieh"". They decided to implement the interior design of their lost Mosque in the new place. This strategy enabled them overcome ""the traumatic experience of displacement and heritage loss."" Also, to safeguard their new place, they legally registered their hey'at as an institution, and they wrote a constitution for it. The attempts for modernization, led them to develop beneficiary activities, as well. In this research, a qualitative approach is applied, benefiting from multiple methodologies, including; ethnography, secondary sources, and visual methods. The researcher has attempted to outline the story of the Drapers in preserving their heritage. This study hopefully would be useful for similar traditional organizations, showing how continuity and heritage preservation are possible to achieve for communities having experienced a troubled past.",,"Haj Khan Mirzai Sarraf, Ali",2020,,,OPUS4-5171,Masterarbeit / Diplomarbeit
A new mathematical model for a 3D container packing problem,,"Wir betrachten das Problem der Einzelcontainerpackung eines Unternehmens, das seine Kunden bedienen muss, indem es zuerst die Produkte in Kartons legt und diese dann in einen Container lädt.

Stochastic mixed-integer programming for a spare parts inventory management problem,,"The German Armed Forces provide an operation contingent to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Response Force (NRF). For this purpose, a &#8222;warehouse"" containing accommodations, food supplies, medical supplies, and spare parts for the systems has to be available. Such a warehouse is restricted in weight, in order to be quickly movable in an upcoming deployment situation. It should be able to supply the NRF troops for a certain amount of time (e.g., one month) without re-supply from the outside. To ensure optimal use of such a restricted warehouse, we developed the computer program &#8222;The OPtimization of a Spare Parts Inventory"" (TOPSPIN) to find an optimal mix of spare parts to restore a set of systems to functionality. Each system is composed of several parts, and it can only be used again in the mission if all broken parts are replaced. The failure rate of the individual parts follows a given random distribution, and during deployment it is expected to be higher than in the homeland. Due to the stochastic nature of the problem, we generate scenarios that simulate the actual failure of the parts. The backbone of TOPSPIN is a mixed-integer linear program that determines an optimal, scenario-robust mix of spare parts and is solved using standard state-of-the-art numerical solvers. Using input data provided by the Logistikzentrum, we analyze how many scenarios need to be generated in order to determine reliable solutions. Moreover, we analyze the composition of the warehouse over a variety of different weight restrictions, and we calculate the number of repairable systems as a function of this bound.",,"Johannsmann, Leonie M.; Craparo, Emily M.; Dieken, Thor L.; Fügenschuh, Armin; Seitner, Björn O.",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5080,,OPUS4-5080,Arbeitspapier
An empirical and simulation-based assessment of tree growth in temperate alley-cropping systems,,"The potential of biomass generated from dedicated energy crops, used in short-rotation coppices (SRC), progressively grows recognition as a flexible primary source for the generation of energy, heat, fuel, and bio-based materials and chemicals. The alley-cropping systems (ACSs), which can integrate tree strips managed as SRC into agriculturally managed fields, are often regarded as an adaptable multi-crop land-use strategy that can provide ecological and economic benefits. The research aim of the present dissertation has focused on investigating the prospective implications of different site-specific conditions and scenarios on tree growth in ACSs with SRC, thus incorporating several experimental and simulation-based studies. For this, the ability of a process-oriented, eco-physiological tree growth model was investigated in order to (i) impute missing empirical data, thus securing a reliable repository of tree growth characteristics, (ii) simulate the tree growth in terms of woody biomass production in strong relation to the interactions with adjacent crops and their respective resource capture, (iii) predict and evaluate the tree growth sensitivity to prospective climate changes, thus performing risk assessments for the near and distant future, and (iv) derive and assess the land equivalent ratio (LER) and gross energy yield for different climatic, soil, and management scenarios. The findings have corroborated the potential tree growth vulnerability to prospective climatic changes, particularly to changes in water availability, and have underlined the importance of coping management strategies in SRC for forthcoming risk assessments and adaptation scenarios. Both LER and gross energy yields had resulted in a convex curve where the maximum values were achieved when either the tree or crop component was dominant (>75% of the land area) and minimum when these components shared similar proportions of land area. Collectively, the implications of different site-specific conditions and scenarios on tree growth in ACSs with SRC have been investigated in order to improve the decision-making, optimization, and adaptation of such systems. Last but not least, this dissertation has emphasized the considerable potential of modelling approaches in ACSs, as they can impute missing data from scarce available data and simulate tree and crop yields for specific site-conditions in a non-intrusive, inexpensive, and prompt way while supporting early site-setup planning.",,"Seserman, Diana-Maria",2020,,,OPUS4-5103,Dissertation
Real-time dynamic hardware reconfiguration for processors with redundant functional units,,"The tiny logic elements in modern integrated circuits increase the rate of transient failures significantly. Therefore, redundancy on various levels is necessary to retain reliability. However, for mixed-criticality scenarios, the typical processor designs offer either too little fault-tolerance or too much redundancy for one part of the applications. Amongst others, we specifically address redundant processor internal functional units (FU) to cope with transient errors and support wear leveling. A real-time operating system (RTOS) was extended to control our prototypical hardware platform and, since it can be configured deterministically within few clock cycles, we are able to reconfigure the FUs dynamically, at process switching time, according to the specified critically of the running processes. Our mechanisms were integrated into the Plasma processor and the Plasma-RTOS. With few changes to the original software code, it was, for example, possible to quickly change from fault-detecting to fault-correcting modes of the processor on demand.",,"Rotta, Randolf; Segabinazzi Ferreira, Raphael; Nolte, Jörg",2020,10.1109/ISORC49007.2020.00035,"10.1109/VLSISOC.2006.313256, 10.1109/LATW.2019.8704560, ",OPUS4-5203,Konferenzveröffentlichung
Near-net-shape semi-finished products for the local reinforcement and repair of fibre reinforced plastics,,"The European Parliament and Council has defined a mandatory specific emission target of 95 g CO2/km by 2020 for passenger cars. Vehicle weight is a significant factor contributing to fuel consumption. Reducing the weight of the vehicle can be one promising option for decreasing CO2 emissions, which becomes a top priority for the automotive industry. In this research, two approaches were used to address the need. One involved developing structural parts using fibre reinforced plastics (FRP), and the other involved designing and developing FRP-metal hybrid laminates, which were constructed by reinforcing FRP locally to the metal surface. Existing joining techniques such as riveting, bolting, adhesive joining, ultrasonic welding, and flow drill joining techniques require additional processing steps to perform the joining, which could considerably increase processing time, cost, and energy expenditure. The present work describes a method to join FRP and metals using the adhesion strength of the investigated polymers. The developed FRP-metal hybrid laminates combine the advantages of metal and FRP together. Steel hot-stamping is known to yield very high strength. Fibre reinforced plastic-metal hybrid laminates were developed using hot stamped steels to transfer their superior mechanical properties to the final structure. To utilize the complete lightweight potential of thermoset and thermoplastic polymers, FRPs and FRP-metal hybrid laminates were developed using both the polymers. Along with this increased demand for FRP structures, there is growing interest in a repair technique in the automotive industry. The second objective of this thesis consists of designing and developing a new repair technique, which regains the strength and stiffness properties of the damaged part. The existing scarf repair technique is not suitable for thin laminates, which have limited access to the damaged area. Perforation damages were introduced into the FRP structures using a low-velocity impact load. A modified injection repair technique is used to repair these damaged FRP structures. Non-destructive techniques were utilized to understand the damage and the effectiveness of the repair.",,"Santhanakrishnan Balakrishnan, Venkateswaran",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5266,,OPUS4-5266,Dissertation
Tattoo taboo : a reader,,"In different parts of the world, tattoos historically have been expression of the socio-cultural identity of individuals or communities: Tattoos are firmly integrated into social practices as elements of initiation or marriage, in other parts of the world, however, tattoos carry negative associations being linked to immorality, and crime. To research the practice of and places associated with tattooing a research-based study project was designed to address the practice of tattooing from the point of view of its cultural heritage values, both intangible and tangible. In the winter semester 2018/2019 this study project was offered jointly by the Chair of Architectural Conservation and the Department of Heritage Management at the Brandenburg University of Technology (BTU) Cottbus-Senftenberg. Twelve international students from the study programmes World Heritage Studies and Architecture participated in this study project, which included a field trip to London and Oxford and several interviews and interactions with researchers and academics from the fields of tattoo history, anthropology, medical sciences and museography. A collection of students' essays on this topic is presented in this reader with a particular focus on the tangible and intangible aspects of tattooing, and the spatial history of tattooing based on two distinct areas in London as a case study. The papers are divided into three distinctive themes that are linked to the practice of tattooing. Section one is dedicated to tattoos as a form of heritage, the one to tattooing as a form of art, and the last one to mapping as a methodological tool to visualise, assess and present relationships between heritage, tattooing practice and its connection to the social fabric in London at the turn of the penultimate century.",,"Skedzuhn-Safir, Alexandra; Franceschini, Nicole",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5236,,OPUS4-5236,Bericht
"Development of Ni-based superalloy metal matrix composites, featuring high creep resistance",,"The increasing demand for competitive, whilst also environment-friendly airplane travel, compels the design of highly efficient engines in the aeronautical field. A potential for improvement of traditional polycrystalline Ni-based superalloys, aiming higher creep resistance, was investigated. The approach adopted the concept of metal matrix composites (MMCs) to incorporate a rigid discontinuous phase, in the form of particles, to a &#947;'-strengthened Ni-based superalloy. In order to make the concept feasible, different microstructures resulting from diverse manufacturing techniques were investigated. By using distinct mixing and sintering methods, powders of Inconel X-750 and TiC were combined to form composites containing 15 vol.% of reinforcing particles. Powders were prepared with low and high energy milling processes, and formed by uniaxial pressure sintering and spark plasma sintering methods. Non-reinforced variants and composites had microstructures thoroughly examined at their initial state and after long isothermal aging treatments. Selected variants were further submitted to tensile and compression creep tests at temperatures between 700 and 800 °C, in the stress range of 200 to 500 MPa. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using techniques such as EBSD, XRD Rietveld refinement, EDS and TEM to evaluate the development of &#947;', &#951; and TiC phases, determining the achievable microstructures with each fabrication method and establishing their evolution after aging treatments over times up to 1000 h. Likewise, creep properties were analyzed by obtaining parameters such as creep exponents, threshold stresses and activation energies. A creep life estimation was conducted with the use of a Monkman-Grant relationship and a Larson-Miller parametrization. Lastly, the potential for a reduction in creep strain rates in a working turbine blade, considering the density of investigated materials as a parameter, was evaluated. All produced composites presented power law creep, with dislocations surpassing &#947;' particles by climb. The variant produced by high energy ball milling and spark plasma sintering exhibited the highest creep rates, resulting from intense diffusion through grain boundaries. It also presented &#951; phase after long isothermal aging, which affects negatively the creep resistance. Contrastingly, in the variant produced by low mixing combined with pressure sintering the lowest creep rates were observed. It was proposed that reinforcing TiC particles effectively acted as a load bearing phase, counterbalancing the adverse effects of the intergranular diffusion in the refined microstructure. Furthermore, a higher microstructural stability was observed in this variant, resulting from limited interaction between TiC particles and the matrix during fabrication.",,"Lemos, Georges",2020,,,OPUS4-5398,Dissertation
The potential role of Power-to-Gas in the Russian-European energy system,,"The modern world is currently facing the energy revolution due to the decarbonisation challenges, promoted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The well-established fossil fuel energy sources are being pushed from their leading market positions by renewable energy. European governments are some of the first to take decisive action towards decarbonisation and have already started reforming their economic sectors. New questions arising from such changes are influencing the role of Russia in supplying energy to the European market. The development of a market for renewable gas, especially renewable hydrogen in Europe, could potentially, in a long-term scenario up to 2050, be an option for Russia to help maintain demand and remain in the role as a main exporter. The focus of this master thesis is put on the assessment of the current state of readiness of Russian and European energy systems for integration of Power-to-Gas (PtG) systems and for development of a carbon-free hydrogen market. German internal green hydrogen production capacity cannot meet the approximate demand in 2030 and 2050. However, the presence of the unutilised power capacity from Russian nuclear and hydro power plants opens a new opportunity to generate economically attractive hydrogen in large volumes via electrolysis with low electricity costs and zero carbon dioxide footprint. In this thesis different supply chains for hydrogen export (Russia-Germany) are constructed and, as a result, the levelised costs of hydrogen (LCOH) are calculated and analysed. Hydrogen produced in Russia and transported to Germany via maritime shipment shows that it can already be competitive to the domestically produced green hydrogen in Germany. The main compartment of the LCOH is the electricity expenditure, which the current Russian industrial tariffs can reach up to 90% of the total costs. Further reductions of the electricity price for PtG systems are recommended in order to achieve lower results for the LCOH. The outcome of this master thesis provides an overview on the current readiness of Russian and German hydrogen infrastructure and further recommendations on how it should be adapted. Finally a 2050 roadmap for the implementation of a hydrogen market in Russia and Germany is developed.",,"Lenivova, Veronika",2020,,,OPUS4-5221,Masterarbeit / Diplomarbeit
Lightweight digital shadow concept for batch size one products and modular shopfloors,,"The Digital Twin is seen as the step towards digitalization in many areas, including the area of manufacturing which is the focus of this paper. However, the frequently application-oriented development of concepts and initial implementations make it difficult to adapt them to other applications. Especially when production deviates from the usual highly automated processes and requires high flexibility, e.g. to allow batch size one. In such a case, the Digital Twin must support modular shopfloors with flexible areas in which different production times and various tools and machines are used. It should also be possible to react promptly to problems in production. Design errors that only become apparent during production must be reported directly. In order to deal with this problem, the paper presents a concept for an abstract representation of a Digital Shadow (DS). The DS combines the disciplines of production planning and control, product lifecycle and layout planning which creates new links and enables further application scenarios. Based on this Digital Shadow, different applications can be realized that provide user-related solutions. For this purpose, a tree structure is used that links information about the product and the production environment which in this case is variable.",,"Schmitt, Randolf; Borck, Christian; Hentschel, Christian; Berger, Ulrich",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5220,,OPUS4-5220,Bericht
Evaluating the effect of multi-objective calibration on the modeling of catchment-scale hydrology and nitrogen load,,"Process-based hydrological models, which simulate nitrogen load from its sources to the receiving waterbody, play an important role in supporting catchment management. The reliability of those models, such as the representative model SWAT used in this study, is determined by a sound calibration and the analysis of the prediction uncertainty. The multi-objective calibration approach prevails the classic single-objective calibration on the spatial parameterization of specific processes. However, the requirement of additional observations and practical procedures limits its application. Moreover, the prediction uncertainty of nitrogen load is inevitable and should also be quantified. This study is a scientific contribution to catchment management by overcoming the challenge with a systematic, well-founded concept of multi-objective calibration and uncertainty analysis for nitrogen load simulation in data-scarce catchments. The concept is tested and proofed by its practical applicability on the Yuan River Catchment (YRC) in China and leads to a generalized, recommended procedure for catchment management application as valuable progress in this field. The study proposed to apply three groups of objectives, multi-site, multi-objective-function, and multi-metric. The applicability and the advantages of two multi-objective calibration approaches, Euclidean Distance and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II were analyzed. To quantify the prediction uncertainty, the study proposed to use the simulations with the highest or the lowest percent bias to represent the uncertainty band of the nitrogen load from the critical source areas (CSAs) and to the stream. The data-scarcity of the YRC was overcome by metrics obtained from open-access satellite-based datasets and metrics extracted from the existing discharge observations. Results show that multi-objective calibration has ensured the model's better performance in terms of the spatial parameterization, the magnitude of the output time-series and the water balance components, in comparison to single-objective calibration. The predicted CSAs showed that 50% of the total nitrogen (TN) loading to the stream was from 26.3% to 37.1% of the area in the YRC. Meanwhile, over 50% of those TN were from the paddy field. Recommendations for application go to the multi-objective calibration considering all three groups of objectives. Approaches to obtain multi-metric objectives in the YRC are also applicable for catchments with data-scarcity. Recommendations for nitrogen management in the YRC is to emphasize the CSAs identified, especially the paddy field.",,"He, Qianwen",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5233,,OPUS4-5233,Dissertation
Branch-and-refine for solving time-dependent problems,,"Einer der Standardansätze zur Lösung zeitabhängiger diskreter Optimierungsprobleme, wie z.B. das Problem des Handlungsreisenden mit Zeitfenstern oder das Kürzeste Wege Problem mit Zeitfenstern, ist die Herleitung einer sogenannten zeitindizierten Formulierung. Wenn dem Problem eine Struktur zu Grunde liegt, die durch einen Graphen beschrieben werden kann, basiert die zeitindizierte Formulierung normalerweise auf einem anderen, erweiterten Graphen, der in der Literatur als zeitexpandierter Graph bezeichnet wird. Der zeitexpandierte Graph kann oft so generiert werden, dass alle Zeitbeschränkungen bereits aufgrund seiner Topologie erfüllt sind und somit Algorithmen für die entsprechende zeitunabhängige Variante angewendet werden können. Der Nachteil dieses Ansatzes ist, dass die Mengen der Ecken und Bögen des zeitexpandierten Graphen viel größer sind als die des ursprünglichen Graphen. In neueren Arbeiten hat sich jedoch gezeigt, dass für viele praktische Anwendungen eine partielle Expandierung des Graphen, die möglicherweise zeitunmögliche Pfade zulässt, oft ausreicht, um eine beweisbar optimale Lösung zu finden. Diese Ansätze verfeinern iterativ den ursprünglichen Graphen und lösen in jeder Iteration eine Relaxierung der zeitexpandierten Formulierung. Wenn die Lösung der aktuellen Relaxation alle Zeitbeschränkungen erfüllt, kann daraus eine optimale Lösung abgeleitet werden, und der Algorithmus terminiert. In dieser Arbeit stellen wir neue Ideen vor, die das Übertragen von Informationen über die optimale Lösung eines gröberen Graphen zu einem verfeinerten Graphen ermöglichen und zeigen, wie diese in Algorithmen verwendet werden können. Genauer gesagt stellen wir einen neuen Algorithmus zur Lösung von MILP-Formulierungen (Mixed Integer Linear Program) von zeitabhängigen Problemen vor, der es ermöglicht, die Graphenverfeinerung während der Untersuchung des Branch-and-Bound Baums durchzuführen, anstatt jedes Mal neu zu starten, wenn die optimale Lösung sich als nicht zulässig herausgestellt hat. Um die praktische Relevanz dieses Algorithmus zu demonstrieren, präsentieren wir Ergebnisse von numerische Experimenten seiner Anwendung auf das Kürzeste Wege Problem mit Zeitfenstern und das Problem des Handlungsreisenden mit Zeitfenstern.",,"Gnegel, Fabian; Fügenschuh, Armin",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5199,,OPUS4-5199,Arbeitspapier
Quantitative empirical studies on sustainable consumption,,"The overall research goal of this doctoral thesis is to better understand the determinants of sustainable purchase behaviour. By approaching several context-specific subgoals in a series of four quantitative empirical studies, major research gaps in the field of sustainable consumption are addressed. The first article examines the market potential for social banking in Germany. By means of an experimental survey using adaptive conjoint analysis, a sample of 2896 German social banking customers and a population-representative sample of 641 German conventional banking customers are compiled. Logistic regression modelling reveals that social banking customers differ significantly from their conventional counterparts regarding several consumer characteristics. The results further indicate a large untapped market potential ranging between 10 and 26% of the German population in 2011. The second article investigates the phenomenon of the attitude-behaviour gap in the context of sustainable clothing. Based on survey data of 1085 female German consumers, a structural equation model is estimated to assess how large the possible gap between a positive attitude towards sustainable clothing and the corresponding purchase behaviour is. Apart from a considerable attitude-behaviour gap, the article indicates that a positive attitude, self-transcendence values, as well as an affinity to online and catalogue shopping, significantly enhance sustainable clothing purchases. Self-enhancement values and, remarkably, a preference for durability constitute purchase barriers. The third article studies the influence of product lifetime labelling by the example of electrical appliances. Using choice-based conjoint analysis, experimental survey data is collected from a population-representative sample of 499 German consumers. Hierarchical Bayes utility modelling suggests a decreasing positive effect of the label on purchase decisions and a deterioration of the purchase influence of existing brands. Structural equation modelling indicates, for instance, that the preference for a long product lifetime is fostered by a respective positive attitude and subjective norm. However, the attitude only exerts a significant influence if it is driven by personal rather than environmental gains. The fourth article sheds light on the effects of favourable and unfavourable environmental product information. The analysis draws on data gained from a survey-based experiment conducted among a population-representative sample of 524 German consumers. Using a two-level structural equation model, the results document that the negative effect caused by unfavourable product carbon footprint information on consumers' willingness to pay is significantly stronger than the positive effect caused by respective favourable information. Furthermore, consumers tend to not substantially differentiate between different high-range degrees of positive or negative environmental information.",,"Jacobs, Kathleen",2020,,,OPUS4-5333,Dissertation
Convexity in graphs: vertex order characterisations and graph searching,,"We study convexities designed to characterise some of the most fundamental classes of graphs. To this end, we present some known results on this topic in a slightly different form, so as to give a homogeneous representation of a very disparate field. Furthermore, we present some new results on the Caratheodory number of interval graphs and also give a more or less exhaustive account of everything that is known in this context on AT-free graphs, including new results on characterising linear vertex orders and the structure of the intervals of this class. We introduce the new class of bilateral AT-free graphs which is motivated by the linear order characterisation and the convexity used to describe AT-free graphs. We discuss their relation to other known classes and consider the complexity of recognition. Furthermore, as a consequence of notions from abstract convexity we present algorithmic results with regards to some natural subclasses of these. As an application of notion of an extreme vertex of a convex geometry, we discuss structural aspects of avoidable vertices in graphs, which form a generalisation of simplicial vertices. This includes a characterisation of avoidable vertices as simplicial vertices in some minimal triangulation of the graph and a new proof of the existence result. Furthermore, we discuss the algorithmic issues regarding the problem of efficient computation of avoidable vertices in a given graph. This is complemented by an algorithmic application of the concept of avoidable vertices to the maximum weight clique problem, by identifying a rather general class of graphs in which every avoidable vertex is bisimplicial. This leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for the maximum weight clique problem in this class of graphs. Implications of this approach for digraphs are also discussed. All of these results lead to a conjecture concerning the generalisation of avoidable vertices to avoidable paths and we prove this conjecture for paths of length less or equal to two. Finally, we analyse the properties of many different and widely used forms of graph search. Here, we discuss the problem of recognising whether a given vertex can be the last vertex visited by some fixed graph search. Moreover, we present some new aspects of the problem of deciding whether a given spanning tree of a graph is a graph search tree of a particular type of search. We generalise the concept of such trees to many well-known searches and give a broad analysis of the computational complexity of this problem. Both of these discussions are motivated by the use of graph searches in the context of computing properties of convexity.",,"Beisegel, Jesse",2020,,,OPUS4-5145,Dissertation
Investigation of PSSS technologies to achieve 100 Gbps and beyond,,"The requirement for wireless communication with a speed beyond 100 Gbps is growing. There are mainly two possible approaches to achieve 100 Gbps system. One approach is to target lower transmission bandwidth and very high spectral efficiency. This method requires advanced digital signal processing operations, which are power-hungry. Another possible path is to go for a high-transmission bandwidth and a moderate spectral efficiency. We decided for this direction to implement a 100 Gbps system. We have chosen parallel sequence spread spectrum (PSSS) as an analog-friendly mixed-signal modulation where most of the baseband processing is in the analog domain, and only a small part is in the digital domain. For the channel equalization, we consider an ""effective channel"" that takes into account the wireless channel and the effects of the transmitter and receiver hardware impairments. The influence of the nonlinear channel response was analyzed for a PSSS modulated signal by employing the RAPP model for the power amplifier. For the first time, we performed a Hardware-In-The-loop experiment using PSSS modulation in the terahertz band. A PSSS modulated signal at a chip rate of 20 Gcps with spectral efficiency of 4 bit/s/Hz is transmitted using a 230 GHz RF-frontend operating in the linear range to achieve a data rate of 80 Gbps. One more important property is that the channel estimation and equalization are performed in the analog domain. A high-speed channel equalization algorithm was developed and implemented on FPGA/ASIC, which operates at(1/10)th of PSSS symbol rate. A parallel PSSS encoder transmitter architecture was designed to work at a high chip rate, and it was implemented on FPGA /ASIC and had an energy efficiency of 0.21 pJ bit&#8722;1 on 28nm ASIC. In this Thesis, we put forward a case for the analog-friendly modulation scheme called PSSS. This scheme does not only modulates the signal but rather builds up an eco-system (such as channel estimation, equalization, and synchronization), which is responsible for the baseband operation.",,"Krishnegowda, Karthik",2020,,,OPUS4-5205,Dissertation
"Learning from the past, designing for the future : sustainability of the Mediterranean vernacular",,"With climate change and the depleting ozone layer, awareness about protecting the environment is increasing and ""Sustainable Architecture"" is becoming an essential part of the architectural future of cities. However, sustainable buildings of today are being built with high cost, high tech systems which can be reduced by taking advantage of past technologies and systems. The brilliance of vernacular architecture and the way man adapted to his surroundings fascinated me and inspired me to do further research on the sustainable characteristics of vernacular settlements of the Mediterranean area in order to determine if these characteristics can be applied to present and future architecture in an innovative way to create sustainable buildings with least possible energy consumption. The method of research was based upon a general analysis of the passive design (solar and wind) characteristics of a town or settlement in Mediterranean climate starting from its site elements such as topography, vegetation, water. After that its urban structure, such as the geometry, block and street orientation and dimensions. Following that, the dwelling characteristics like dwelling shape, orientation and dimensions and finally the thermal regulating elements found in these dwellings, such as windows and vegetation. These elements were given a score according to their contribution to energy savings in buildings. Four case studies were chosen: two vernacular case studies from the region of study (the Mediterranean Coasts) and two modern case studies inspired by the Mediterranean vernacular. The analysis was repeated in the same sequence mentioned: Site, Settlement, Dwelling, Element, for the actual performance of each case study. The elements were given a number of points out of the score assigned for each element in the general analysis. A total score and rating for each case study resulted from this analysis. The objective of these scores were to compare the performance of the vernacular case studies to the vernacular inspired case studies in terms of energy savings. The final scores displayed comparable results between both types of case studies meaning that when these modern settlements were designed with an influence from the Mediterranean vernacular, their performance in energy savings was close to that of a vernacular settlement. That means that it is possible to design settlements which are influenced by vernacular settlements and can even defeat them by following the general guidelines of the vernacular passive design characteristics in addition to modern tools and innovative methods. These guidelines can be reflected in a handbook and rating system which can become a simple step by step guide for architects and planners to design sustainable settlements without the need for expensive and complicated rating systems and consultants.",,"Elattassi, Najla",2020,,,OPUS4-5309,Dissertation
Applying the stream-processing paradigm to ultra high-speed communication systems,,"In the last 30 years, communication became one of the most important pillars of our civilization. Every day terabytes of information are moved wired and wireless between computers. In order to transport this amount of data, researchers and industry increase the data rates of the underlying communication networks with impressive speed. However, such ultra-high data rates are unavailable at the communication endpoints. One reason why ultra-high data rates are still not available for the communication endpoints is their inability to handle the protocol processing at this data rate. In order to enable communication endpoints to process high-volume data streams, the protocol processing has to be parallelized and optimized on all processing levels. However, parallelization and optimization are cumbersome tasks, which are further complicated as the protocol processing is traditionally carried out by the operating system. This thesis aims at circumventing these problems by moving the protocol processing into external processing hardware and interpreting communication protocols as stream processing problems. In order to achieve ultra-high data rates at the communication endpoints, a protocol stream processing design approach was developed and evaluated. The design process is separated into implementation, soft real-time analysis, parallelization, and mapping steps, which allow a scalable protocol implementation without paradigm changes. Furthermore, a data link protocol for 100 Gbit/s wireless was developed and implemented with the new stream processing design concept, in order to show its feasibility. The data link protocol is configurable for different communication conditions and easy to parallelize by providing different granularities of packets. The proposed design-process has shown to be suitable for uncovering bottlenecks and helping with debugging the individual stages of the protocol.",,"Büchner, Steffen",2020,,,OPUS4-5246,Dissertation
On bilevel optimization problems in infinite-dimensional spaces,,"In this thesis we consider bilevel optimization problems in infinite-dimensional spaces. In particular, we are interested in providing first-order necessary optimality conditions. We consider bilevel optimization problems both in abstract Banach spaces and in some special situations. This includes the optimal control of the obstacle problem, which is a typical bilevel optimization problem in Sobolev spaces, as well as a class of inverse optimal control problems. We obtain optimality conditions for these more specific optimization problems by applying our results from the abstract setting. Our main approach for deriving optimality conditions in the abstract setting utilizes the relaxation of a reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem via the optimal value function. We also introduce the so-called normal-cone-preserving operators and show how this concept can be applied. We also consider other topics that arise in this context. For instance, we investigate the so-called limiting normal cone to a complementarity set in Sobolev spaces. This complementarity set plays a central role in the context of the optimal control of the obstacle problem. The limiting normal cone is a concept which appears in the area of variational analysis and generalizes the usual normal cone from convex analysis. We also investigate in which spaces Legendre forms and Legendre-* forms can exist. We show that if a Legendre-* form exists in a reflexive Banach space or a space with a separable predual space, then this space is already isomorphic to a Hilbert space. We also consider a discretization of a bilevel optimization problem in Lebesgue spaces. We present both theoretical error estimates and numerical experiments. The new results in this thesis are illustrated by examples and counterexamples. In order to present the topics in a self-contained way, we review some known concepts and their basic properties. A particular focus for this is on the definitions and properties from the area of capacity theory.",,"Harder, Felix",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5375,,OPUS4-5375,Dissertation
Enhancement of tensile fracture resistance of metal-injection-molded &#946; titanium alloys biomaterials via diverse sintering pathways,,"The powder metallurgically produced beta titanium alloys (traditional PM beta Ti-alloys) have long been plagued by high impurities contamination. For binder-based powder technologies, they originate from the sintering atmosphere, the debinding processes and the starting powders. In general, a normal carbon residual of binder-based powder technologies is capable of incurring the formation of aligned TiCx particles along beta grain boundaries (GB-TiCx) in most classes of beta Ti-alloys. Whereas, oxygen atoms are likely to deteriorate the ductility of PM Ti alloys by promoting the formation of diverse brittle phases and/or altering the deformation modes. Such materials exhibiting rather low toughness to strain ratios are not an option for critical structural applications, where catastrophic damage is completely unacceptable. In this study, biotolerant metastable beta Ti-20Nb-10Zr alloys, containing a certain amount of carbon, oxygen residuals originated from materials processing and consequently 0.5 vol.% in situ synthesized TiCx particles, were fabricated via metal-injection-molding (MIM). With varying yttrium (Y) addition, the effects of Y-induced oxygen scavenging, beta-grain refinement and porosity increment on tensile properties were systematically investigated. To scavenge oxygen from the beta Ti-matrix, the Y elemental powder with a maximum particle size of 15 µm (e.g. <12 µm or 1200 mesh) is more appropriate than the commonly used <45 µm (i.e. 325 mesh) sized powder or larger ones and without significant detrimental effect on the as-sintered density of beta Ti-alloys. A novel toughening strategy was proposed by regulating TiCx precipitation evolution and resultantly adjusting particles distribution pattern. Synchrotron radiation identified that two separate TiCx precipitation-type reactions occurred at the beta phase region and the alpha/beta region. In a narrow temperature range between these two precipitation reactions, dissolution of carbides was observed just below alpha/beta transus. Y addition can postpone TiCx precipitation. On the basis of those mechanisms, adjusting TiCx particle distribution was proposed for the first time, specifically a combination of yttrium addition (Y) and carbide spheroidization reprecipitation annealing (CSRA). As a result, aligned GB-TiCx particles were adjusted to dispersed intragranular TiCx particles. An apparent toughening effect (&#8776; 113% increment reaching elongation = 8.3%) was achieved after TiCx redistribution, while non-optimally aligned TiCx pattern seriously limited tensile toughness of materials. Here, the mechanisms of TiCx redistribution behavior and its toughening are elucidated systematically.",,"Xu, Peng",2020,10.26127/BTUOpen-5512,,OPUS4-5512,Dissertation
Novel type of biomedical titanium-manganese-niobium alloy fabricated by arc melting and metal injection moulding,,"Titanium and its alloys have been widely used as implant biomaterials due to their suitable combination of mechanical properties and biological compatibilities. At present, about 70-80% of implants are made of metallic biomaterials. Compared with magnesium alloys, stainless steel and cobalt alloys, titanium alloys have a higher specific strength, high corrosion resistance, and excellent biocompatibility. With research, Ti-Nb biomedical titanium alloys have been constantly developed. In the Ti-Nb alloy, the amount of Nb is usually from 16% to 42% (wt.%) which is about 10% to 30% (at.%). As reported, Mn as a trace element to the human body has the potential to be used in bio-materials. Therefore, this study aims at the partial replacement of Nb by Mn to reduce the costs, without deteriorating the mechanical properties. Moreover, it must be ensured good biocompatibility and corrosion resistance. This is the first investigated on Ti-Mn-Nb ternary alloys. In this work, According to &#946; single-phase field, Ti-xMn-yNb (x=4, 10, 16; y=2, 8, 14, at.%) alloys (arc-melted) have been fabricated. The Ti-Mn-Nb alloys are investigated by optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), hardness test, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and mechanical testing. By screening study on alloy, Ti-10Mn-14Nb (at.%) (Ti-10Mn-23.7Nb (wt.%)) is the optimal alloy with tensile strength (760 MPa) and elongation (10.5%). After that, the Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) is used to prepare Ti-Mn-Nb alloys. The MIM method can greatly reduce the processing cost. MIM Ti-xMn-yNb (x=3, 4, 6; y=1, 2, 4, at.%), Ti-4Mn-14Nb and Ti-10Mn-14Nb alloys are fabricated. Among them, a very good combination of mechanical properties is achieved for MIM processed Ti-4Mn-2Nb (at.%) (Ti-4.5Mn-3.8Nb (wt.%)), namely a YS of 642 MPa, UTS of 725 MPa and high ductility of 16% elongation to fracture. With further investigations, when the yttrium content is 0.1% (at.%), the tensile strength of Ti-4Mn-2Nb-0.1Y (at.%) (Ti-4.5Mn-3.8Nb-0.18Y (wt.%)) is increased to 785 MPa while elongation of 12.9%. These mechanical properties already exceed Ti-6Al-4V (ASTM F2885 Grade 5 undensified). In the in vitro evaluation, in comparison with MIM pure titanium, human osteoblasts MG63 adhered as well and proliferated on the surface of MIM Ti-Mn-Nb specimens. In the supernatant after cell culture, the Ti-Mn-Nb alloy shows similar osmolality and pH value results as MIM pure titanium. By LDH assay and DNA isolation, the MIM Ti-Mn-Nb alloys are not found to be toxic to MG63 cells. In the study of corrosion resistance in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) at 37 °C, the corrosion current densities as well as the impedance of MIM Ti-Mn-Nb alloys are all better than those of MIM pure titanium and even better than those of MIM Ti-6Al-4V alloy.",,"Zhang, Haoyin",2020,,,OPUS4-5128,Dissertation

Run-time hardware reconfiguration of functional units to support mixed-critical applications,,"System reconfiguration of hardware resources has been done in multiple system domains. Such systems are usually found in the context of FPGAs, where reconfiguration is done usually over its primitives (e.g., LUTs, Flip-Flops). Or even in the context of MPSoC designs, where core management (e.g., lock-step operation in multi-core designs) is the most used approach. However, recent works have shown that configuration at Functional Units (FUs) granularity might come with benefits. For example, it can increase the configuration space due to its finer granularity, and, as a consequence, the options to deal with problems (e.g., due to aging) in the units itself. Within this context, this paper presents a system capable to configure its FUs (e.g., ALUs, multipliers, dividers) into different operation modes. The system uses an Operating System to control HW reconfiguration during process switching time and takes into account the health state of its units in a mixed-criticality applications scenario. Results show that, within this scenario, the system is able to reconfigure itself accomplishing health state modifications of its HW elements.",,"Segabinazzi Ferreira, Raphael; Nolte, Jörg; Vargas, Fabian; George, Nevin; Hübner, Michael",2020,10.1109/LATS49555.2020.9093692,"10.23919/DATE.2018.8342259, 10.1109/INTELES.2014.7008982, 10.1145/2463209.2488857, 10.1145/2785988, 10.1109/DFT.2017.8244440, 10.1109/MDAT.2017.2750902, 10.1145/3125501.3125509, 10.1109/LATW.2019.8704560, 10.1109/TC.2015.2449840, 10.1109/FPL.2013.6645497, 10.1109/LATW.2018.8349676, ",OPUS4-5180,Konferenzveröffentlichung

Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of lignin and lignin-based composites for active food packaging applications,,"Due to the use of fossil fuel resources, many environmental problems have been increasingly growing. Thus, the recent research focuses on the use of environment friendly materials from sustainable feedstocks for future fuels, chemicals, fibers and polymers. Lignocellulosic biomass has become the raw material of choice for these new materials. Recently, the research has focused on using lignin as a substitute material in many industrial applications. The antiradical and antimicrobial activity of lignin and lignin-based films are both of great interest for applications such as food packaging additives. DPPH assay was used to determine the antioxidant activity of Kraft lignin compared to Organosolv lignins from different biomasses. The purification procedure of Kraft lignin showed that double-fold selective extraction is the most efficient confirmed by UV-Vis, FTIR, HSQC, 31PNMR, SEC, and XRD. The antioxidant capacity was discussed regarding the biomass source, pulping process, and degree of purification. Lignin obtained from industrial black liquor are compared with beech wood samples: Biomass source influences the DPPH inhibition (softwood > grass) and the TPC (softwood < grass). DPPH inhibition affected by the polarity of the extraction solvent. Following the trend: ethanol > diethylether > acetone. Reduced polydispersity has positive influence on the DPPH inhibition. Storage decreased the DPPH inhibition but increased the TPC values. The DPPH assay was also used to discuss the antiradical activity of HPMC/lignin and HPMC/lignin/chitosan films. In both binary (HPMC/lignin) and ternary (HPMC/lignin/chitosan) systems the 5% addition showed the highest activity and the highest addition had the lowest. Both scavenging activity and antimicrobial activity are dependent on the biomass source; Organosolv of softwood > Kraft of softwood > Organosolv of grass. Lignins and lignin-containing films showed high antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at 35 °C and at low temperatures (0-7 °C). Purification of Kraft lignin has a negative effect on the antimicrobial activity while storage has positive effect. The lignin leaching in the produced films affected the activity positively and the chitosan addition enhances the activity for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Testing the films against food spoilage bacteria that grow at low temperatures revealed the activity of the 30% addition on HPMC/L1 film against both B. thermosphacta and P. fluorescens while L5 was active only against B. thermosphacta. In HPMC/lignin/chitosan films, the 5% addition exhibited activity against both food spoilage bacteria.",,"Al-zagameem, Abla",2020,,,OPUS4-5302,Dissertation
Impact of alkali treatments on the surface and interface properties of Chalcopyrite thin-film solar cell absorbers,,"This thesis focuses on the investigation and characterization of the surfaces and interfaces of chalcopyrite-based Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) thin film solar cells using various x-ray and electron spectroscopies. In particular, the impact of alkali post deposition treatments (PDT) on the chemical and electronic surface and interface structure of CdS/CIGSe absorbers is studied. The structure of ""real world"" CdS/CIGSe interfaces and how they are impacted by different alkali PDTs was investigated by a combination of different x-ray spectroscopies. The interface formation is characterized by studying sample sets with different CdS thicknesses. The chemical environment for indium and cadmium is revealed by deriving the modified Auger parameter &#945;'(In) and &#945;'(Cd) using the kinetic energy of most prominent Auger line together with the binding energy of the chosen core level. A more complex situation is found for CdS/CIGSe samples that underwent NaF+KF PDT, where a K-In-Se compound is initially present on top of the chalcopyrite absorber. The conversion of the K-In-Se type species into a Cd-In-(O,OH,S,Se) interface compound is recorded at short CBD-CdS deposition times. It appears the majority of K that is present at the surface of the NaF+KF PDT CIGSe absorber is dissolved in the CBD and partially re-deposited as K-O type species. The Cd/S ratio clearly deviates from the stoichiometry expected for CdS, and a Cd(O,OH,S)-like compound is likely formed. The electronic structure of CdS/CIGSe interface is similarly more complex for the NaF+KF PDT compared to the NaF PDT case, where only Cd(O,OH,S) buffer was formed. In an attempt to shed more light into this complex situation, the impact of evaporated alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) on the surface structure of CIGSe was studied in-system by synchrotron-based hard x- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES), aiming at understanding the underlying mechanism of the interfacial effect of alkalis on the performance of CIGSe devices. In the case of K deposition, two K species are observed by x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and HAXPES, one of which species disappears at high annealing temperature. Furthermore, three new In contributions (In-O and K-In-Se, metallic In species) can be observed after K evaporation. The evolution of chemical contribution supports the formation of a K-In-Se and Cu-poor CIGSe (1:3:5) bilayer structure that is similar to what was reported for ""real world"" NaF+KF PDTs. Deposition of heavy alkali metals (Rb, Cs) induced the formation of alkali selenide phases after alkali evaporation and during low temperature annealing. Similar chemical changes as seen for the K composition (i.e. presence of metallic In, In-O, and alkali-O) are observed. However, detailed analysis of the Alk/Se ratio and composition provide direct evidence for the formation of a Alk-(In)-Se and (Cu,Alk)(In, Ga)Se2 bilayer. The insights from these studies promise to provide crucial aid to fully exploit alkali pre-treatments in scientific and industrial CIGSe production, and will deliberate use of this means of surface/interface tailoring to push efficiencies even further.",,"Yang, Penghui",2020,,,OPUS4-5177,Dissertation
The method of fundamental solutions for computing interior transmission eigenvalues,,"This thesis deals with a novel approach for analyzing and computing interior transmission eigenvalues of (piecewise) homogeneous media in two dimensions. It is based on approximating boundary data of respective eigenfunctions by the method of fundamental solutions. However, since a straightforward implementation would solely exploit ill-conditioned matrices and thus evoke spurious results, a stabilization scheme is incorporated. The combined method is then studied with a distinction between isotropic and anisotropic materials, and complemented by novel approximation theory each. Numerical validations complete the investigations for different wave type scenarios",,"Pieronek, Lukas",2020,,,OPUS4-5237,Dissertation
"Cultural significance assessment, Panamnagar : a testimony of historic Bengal",,"Conservation of heritage sites is an integral part of history and culture through which new generations can learn about their forefathers education, professionalism, cultural characteristics as well as their civilization. Almost all countries of the world tend to conserve their historical sites for their own generations and travellers from abroad. Despite Bangladeshs economy is becoming stronger, it is not paying enough attention to the development of archaeology to conserve its heritage sites. Unlike many other developing countries, Bangladesh tends to considers it a luxury to preserve it's heritage sites. It is mainly because of the scarcity of land. The tiny country has a huge population (about 180 million), the density of which is perhaps the highest in the world. Apart from some very significant heritage sites, most others are awfully neglected. Lack of education and awareness among the respective local people and other stakeholders are also responsible for most of the heritage sites facing threats of demolition, vandalism, losing authenticity and integrity. Panamnagar, the case study for this thesis paper, is not apart from the above scenario. It is the last surviving intake city of lost Bengal. The place witnessed Mughal emperor, British rule, the partition of Bengal, Liberation war of Bangladesh, Hindu-Muslim riot, illegal habitation of people, forced eviction and abundance. The historic city went through lots of historical events and is still standing as a testimony to the golden era of Bengal. Currently, this heritage site is facing multiple threats to its existence and authenticity. The city is vacated by the authority - the Department of Archaeology. But as the local people are not aware of the historic value of the site, they are not at all cooperating with the authority. Meanwhile, the authority is trying to incorporate adaptive reuse of the site to give life to it again and collect revenue for the maintenance. But they are doing it without assessing the cultural significance of the site properly, which could be a potential threat for the authenticity of the heritage site. Thus, this paper has focused on assessing the cultural significance of the heritage site, with a hope that it will help the authority to make policy decisions for the conservation of the site more cautiously. To assess the cultural significance properly, history and architectural significance are described briefly. A site analysis has been conducted to understand the current site condition properly. The paper concludes with statements in support of the cultural significance of Panamnagar site and recommends appropriate conservation tools to sustain its significance.",,"Sharmin, Nuzhat",2019,,,OPUS4-4868,Masterarbeit / Diplomarbeit
"Climate adaptation planning : an urban structure type approach for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of risks in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",,"Urban adaptation is a critical issue for many of the developing countries of Southeast Asia. Vietnam is likely to be among the countries most adversely affected by climate change. Moreover, its largest city, Ho Chi Minh City is considered worldwide as one of most vulnerable to a multitude of climate-related hazards, including flooding, sea-level rise and extreme heat events. Similar to other rapidly developing megacities in Southeast Asia, Ho Chi Minh City has undergone enormous changes in recent decades and has rapidly developed into an emerging megacity shaped by global processes and local settlement patterns. Recently, the need to adapt to the multiple stressors of rapid urbanisation and climate change has become increasingly evident. Adaptation to climate change in urban areas depends on decision-makers' understanding of the current and future impacts of climate change. Land-use planning as a place-based and problem-solving strategy has been recognised as a key tool in this respect, to mainstream climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction into urban development. Yet a key challenge is a lack of relevant information on exposed populations and assets at risk to planners and policymakers. The dissertation outlines the development of an integrated framework predominantly based on an urban structure type approach. This approach was used to manually interpret high resolution, remotely sensed imagery in order to portray and understand patterns of settlement and urban structure layout of the current and emerging landscapes of Ho Chi Minh City. The approach is able to capture the highly dynamic spatiotemporal, social and structural changes associated with rapid urbanisation. The overall findings show the applicability of the developed framework to produce important input indicators for risk adapted land-use planning. These are ultimately useful to determine hotspots for administrative interventions and to assist prioritising in spatial and urban planning decision-making.",,"Downes, Nigel Keith",2019,,,OPUS4-5118,Dissertation
Narratives of migration and development as discourses in transnational digital migrant media : the case of Kenyan migration to Europe,,"This dissertation examines how migration and development narratives are (re)produced in transnational digital migrant media using an example of Kenyan migration to Europe. It also raises questions about existing gaps in the literature on the role of the media specifically, transnational digital migrant media in constructing influential discourses. It achieves this quest by submitting to an objective to examine the contribution of migrant media discourses to development in migration-sending countries (De Haas, 2007). Using postcolonial-discourse theoretic approach, the thesis analyses the criteria for selection of texts on migration and development, and how the texts inform the discourse. The theoretical concepts of development in this thesis follow Arturo Escobar's (1995) deconstruction of conventional development theory. It includes an appreciation of multi-faceted theoretic dynamics, especially historical effects on development and creation of hegemonic disparities causing migration of Kenyans to Europe. The dissertation explores the relation of liberal development narratives to Postcolonial perspectives of Edward Said (1977), Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (1986) and Homi Bhabha (1983), whose writings expose stereotypes like those found in development constructs. The study highlights similar aspects of representations of migration and development in the media. It does not only expose migrant's contribution to development but accentuates the discourse forming function of migrant media in the production of heterogeneous narratives on migration and development. This reflection is an attempt to look at possibilities of alternative development trajectories in migrant media and Postcolonial texts, that resist neo-colonial economic narratives forced on people of African descent. The findings for this thesis show that migrant media provides hegemonic ideas on development, as well as alternative counter-hegemonic views. Even though poverty and political instability of Africa characterize narratives in the mainstream media, migrant media utilizes new media platforms for ""subalterns"" to be heard. Migrants' inputs on development (re)produced in migrant media, inform a discourse that champions initiatives aimed at improving livelihoods in migration-sending countries. To answer the main sociological question on (re)production of narratives this dissertation learns from Norman Fairclough's (1995, 2012) guidelines to discourse analysis, as informed from Michel Foucault's (1980) theoretic approach. As a qualitative research strategy, the dissertation explores Texts from transnational digital migrant media for Kenyans in Europe (Germany and UK) and expert interviews with Kenyan media producers in Germany and in Britain. On this basis, the thesis argues that not only are media expert's contributors to development but also important creators of a discourse that qualifies migration as a reality in Kenya's development.",,"Ouma Radoli, Lydia",2019,,,OPUS4-4780,Dissertation
The potentials of biological geotextiles in erosion control and of substrate amendment on vegetation establishment during gold-mine reclamation in Ghana,,"Designing and implementing comprehensive reclamation programme during mine operations can minimize environmental damage and decrease potential legal liability. Although Regulation (23) of the Ghana Environmental Assessment Regulation (1999) requires mine proponents to have plans for reclamation, it has been revealed most degraded mine-sites have not been reclaimed. Even in cases where some mining companies made reclamation attempts, such efforts could not produce any favourable outcome due to the failure in adopting such best reclamation management practices as slope stabilization and substrate amendment to promote vegetation establishment. Subsequently, this study was undertaken to (a) investigate the role of biological geotextiles in erosion control and (b) examine effects of organic amendments with stockpiled subsoil on tree growth and on ground vegetation cover. A waste-rock dump was graded to 33% slope and covered with a 70 cm layer of subsoil at the Amoma Pit of Newmont Ghana Gold Limited Ahafo-South project. To achieve the first objective, two kinds of biological geotextiles; Elephant-grass mat and ""York"" mat, were used with bare ground as control, in a randomized block design with two replications each. Mat performance against erosion was expressed as a percentage from the total sediment yield. Results showed both the Elephant-grass mat and the York mat significantly (p < 0.05) reduced soil loss by 56.6% and 97.3%, respectively, compared to the control. The mats acted as cover and protected the graded mine-slope against erosion and allowed vegetation to establish and grow through them. Two experimental plots (24 × 15 m) were established on a different portion of the waste-rock dump for the second objective. The treatments, manure (23 t ha-1) and control (no manure), were applied, followed by seeding of Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and planting of potted-seedlings of five forest-tree species. The Laser-point-quadrat method was used to estimate ground vegetation cover, whereas erosion was visually observed. Diameter and height data of the planted trees were collected. The results indicated the manure had significant positive influence on tree growth and on ground vegetation cover which facilitated superior soil stabilization, compared to the control. Manure supplied sufficient N to overcome N deficiency of the subsoil and additionally increased soil organic matter that boosted microbial activity and mineralization. The findings of the study highlight the urgent need of implementing best reclamation management practices in protecting the environment and securing successful reclamation during mine operations in Ghana. The achievement of this will promote responsible mining and further contribute to Ghanaians' acceptability of mining as a sustainable developmental land use activity, rather than as a curse.",,"Nsiah, Paul Kofi",2019,,,OPUS4-4967,Dissertation
Selective growth and characterization of GeSn nanostructures on patterned Si wafers,,"Over the past seven decades Si microelectronics have developed rapidly. The success of the growing microelectronic industry is also caused by the expansion of materials in addition to Si. Open challenges are the monolithic integration of group IV devices on Si photonics as well as overcoming the size mismatch between electronic parts in the nm range and photonic parts in the µm scale. In this thesis the future application of GeSn NIs on Si as a photodetector is evaluated. The key element required for high performance optoelectronic devices is the formation of high-quality GeSn nano-islands (NIs), i.e. overcoming growth challenges such as introduction of defects due to lattice and thermal mismatch between GeSn and Si substrate as well as suppression of Sn precipitation caused by the limited solid solubility of Sn in Ge. To achieve high-quality nanostructures, the selective growth of GeSn NIs on Si(001) seeds via molecular beam epitaxy is investigated, exploiting the advantages of nanoheteroepitaxy (NHE), i.e. growth on nano-patterned substrates. The best compromise between selective growth of GeSn on Si nano-pillars at significant higher growth temperature than the eutectic temperature of GeSn and the incorporation of Sn into the Ge lattice was achieved at 600°C. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the substitutional incorporation of 1.4at.% Sn into the NIs avoiding considerable Si interdiffusion from the substrate. Transmission electron microscopy images have shown that dislocations and stacking faults caused by plastic relaxation of the GeSn NIs are located near the NIs/substrate interface and thus, dislocation-free GeSn NIs can be formed, due to gliding out of the threading arms triggered by the NHE approach. The high crystal quality of the GeSn NIs, enables the investigation of the bandgap by &#956;-photoluminescence (PL) analyses, demonstrating the shrinkage of the direct bandgap with increasing Sn content in the quasi-direct semiconductor. All NIs however feature a &#946;-Sn droplet on their nano-facets. To suppress the out-diffusion of Sn and hence increase the Sn concentration of the GeSn alloy, the GeSn NIs were overgrown with a thin Ge cap layer. The Ge cap successfully hinders the formation of Sn segregates on top of the NIs. Capping at 600 °C and 650°C results in an enrichment of Sn at the surface, forming a GeSn crust with 8ħ0.5at.% Sn. This wetting layer both enhances the optoelectronic properties of the NI core and exhibits a relatively strong PL emission attributed to direct radiative recombination. Finally, a first demonstration of a GeSn NIs based photodetector was successful, due to the utilization of Al nano-antennas exhibiting an enhanced light coupling into the GeSn NIs at a wavelength of 700nm. The responsible mechanisms is the local plasmonic field enhancement of the incoming light. The manipulation of the resonance wavelength into the telecommunication regime, i.e. >1550nm, have to be investigated in future studies.",,"Schlykow, Viktoria Diana",2019,,,OPUS4-4886,Dissertation
