"Earthquake disaster risk assessment for cultural World Heritage sites : the case of ""Bam and its cultural landscape"" in Iran",,"Despite the continuous effects of natural hazards on cultural heritage and growing body of research on disaster risk assessment, cultural heritage still suffers from the lack of integrated risk assessment methodologies. Within the context of natural hazards, earthquakes need to be differently considered mainly due to the sudden massive destruction without warning and the unpredictability of the exact occurrence time and place. So far, limited sources have been adequately dedicated to developing risk assessment methodologies for cultural heritage. The challenge is to integrate the principles and methods of risk assessment in heritage conservation on one side, and to incorporate particular characteristics of cultural heritage and World Cultural Heritage properties (e.g. the Outstanding Universal Values and associated conditions of authenticity and integrity) into the risk assessment procedure, on the other. There are numerous cultural properties that have been extremely affected by seismic events, such as the historic city of Bam in Iran. The World Heritage site of 'Bam and its Cultural Landscape', as a unique example of a traditional human settlement, is investigated in this research. Because Bam and its Cultural Landscape is located in a high-probability earthquake region and appeared to be highly vulnerable to seismic events, an integrated risk assessment for the property needs to be developed in response to potential earthquakes. Recognising the challenge, a Cultural Heritage Risk Index for Bam is performed to measure the level of risk by aggregating the risk components, which are 'hazard' (earthquakes), 'exposure' (significance of the site elements), and 'vulnerability' (susceptibility and coping capacity). According to the risk index, an earthquake risk map is generated by applying Geographic Information System (GIS) to demonstrate a common understanding of the level of potential impacts on the property. Furthermore, a multiple impact identification matrix supports determining the potential impacts of an earthquake as well as its related secondary hazards and human-induced threats that need to be addressed in a risk preparedness plan. The findings of the research emphasis that in addition to the hazard itself, diverse factors associated with the heritage significance, structural susceptibility, and institutional capacity highly influence the level of risk. The outputs of the risk assessment allows determining site-specific risk reduction strategies, particularly seismic susceptibility reduction and coping capacity building. This provides specialists and practitioners from multiple sectors engaged in the protection of (World) cultural heritage with a practical tool to facilitate risk communication and appropriate risk management planning.",,"Ravankhah, Mohammad",2019,,,OPUS4-5253,Dissertation
Sharing authorities : participatory museum exhibitions with local communities,,"This Master's thesis research investigates how and if sharing authority is happening through a participatory exhibit, specifically by critically analyzing the Community Altar (CA) exhibit at Denver Botanic Gardens (DBG) from 2018. This case was selected partly due to the proliferation of Día de los Muertos exhibits and related celebrations occurring in museums steadily since the 1970s, particularly in a United States context. The context of working with this intangible cultural heritage practice brings up interesting questions in light of intensifying discussions in museum management surrounding equity and sharing authority. Furthermore, methods for examining how to share authority&#8212;particularly through participatory exhibit design with local communities and cultural heritage&#8212;remain lightly explored from theoretical perspectives. Through a qualitative content analysis, this research assesses results from exhibit planning documents and in-person interviews with CA participants and DBG staff members. Ultimately, this research suggests that in order to initiate sharing authority between CA exhibit participants and DBG, empowerment through ""transformative participation"" needs to occur (White, 1996). The planning structure of the CA exhibit should empower involved community members and DBG staff to co-produce exhibit elements in a co-creative way. A discussion around what empowerment means is offered in the end of the study, including that DBG staff can further support Community Altars participants in utilizing lived experience(s) as curatorial authority.",,"Vasconi, Nicole",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-5831,,OPUS4-5831,Buch (Monographie)
Archaeology of wetland commons : Anlo adaptive management of Keta Lagoon,,"Wetlands have gained tremendous importance since the 1970s, both in scientific discussion and in government policy discourse. The Ramsar Convention provided some clarity in definitions of wetlands and their natural and social significance. However, the current scientific understanding of wetlands was constructed in the centers of knowledge production in the West. One of the consequences has been that local knowledge of wetlands has been obscured or ignored altogether. This research uses methods of historical archaeology, ethnography, and archival work to explore the Anlo's local knowledge of wetlands in Ghana. Anlo local knowledge includes unique forms of wetland ownership arrangements, appropriate management approaches, and so-called atsidza are used as epistemic tools. Bryan Norton's conceptual framework of adaptive management gives an important role to local experimentation and is therefore seen as a key tool for sustainable management. Adaptive management is understood as anlo-style consensus-building management to appropriately incorporate local knowledge and western science into wetland management. The concept of adaptive management is modified accordingly to integrate postcolonial studies of knowledge production and thus can also contribute to the critical analysis of the integration of local knowledge, which has tended to be underestimated or even ignored in postcolonial theories.",,"Doe, Jonathan Bill",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-5830,,OPUS4-5830,Buch (Monographie)
Effects of helophyte species and system types in treatment of artificial acid mine drainage under carbon-deficient and sulphate-reducing conditions in laboratory-scale horizontal flow constructed wetlands,,"Surface water has been used by mankind as the main source of water for domestic agriculture and industrial use in numerous countries around the world. However, water quality can be affected by mining activities which influences the natural environment, human health and aquatic ecosystem. The major pollutants in acid mine drainage are high amount of dissolved sulphate and heavy/toxic metals. Constructed wetlands are promising in situ water treatment methods which helps in the remediation process by stimulating microbial growth within the rhizospheric zone of the plants. The sulphate in constructed wetlands are removed by dissimilatory sulphate reduction in strict anaerobic conditions which helps in the removal of metals as metal sulphides. The objective of this research is to investigate sulphate and metal removal pathways in constructed wetlands treating acid mine drainage. Therefore, several approaches were applied: (a) various types of model wetlands were used to investigate different removal processes (b) intensification of treatment processes with stimulation of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction in an autotrophic way by the use of hydrogen gas. The application of hydrogen gas (as external electron donor) combined with common physico-chemical and biological parameters helped us to intensify the sulphate reduction process and removal of metals in constructed wetlands. In the model wetland systems, the removal efficiencies varied with the types of constructed wetlands. The removal efficiencies of sulphate and metals were high in planted constructed wetlands as compared to unplanted constructed wetland. The combination of gravel bed and plants (Phragmites australis) resulted in the highest removal rate in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland. The metals mostly precipitated to the bottom of the constructed wetland as metal sulphides. Though under carbon limited and anoxic conditions, a high mean removal efficiency of sulphate and heavy metals was observed in the experiments with HSSF CW so it is important to take into consideration the importance of electron donor. With hydrogen gas as electron donor the performance efficiency was increased by almost 12% for sulphate removal and almost 6% increase in aluminium removal efficiency. In conclusion, this research exhibit that the combination of physico-chemical measurements along with hydrogen gas as an electron donor is an efficient tool for investigation of sulphate and metal removal processes in constructed wetlands. Such information is not only beneficial for understanding the processes taking place in these wastewater treatment facilities but also necessary for future technological improvement of constructed wetlands.",,"Mohanty, Ashirbad",2019,,,OPUS4-4859,Dissertation
Stochastic modelling of leading-edge noise in time-domain using vortex particles,,"The conceptual designing of rotating machines such as fans, wind turbines, contra-rotating open rotors and helicopter blades require low-cost, easy-to-run tools which allow quick noise assessments and optimization analyses underlying this phenomenon. The state-of-the-art numerical and experimental methods are far more expensive to conduct an optimisation study, whereas inexpensive methods like the analytical ones can have significant errors in realistic geometries at high-frequency ranges, higher angles of attack. The response to large coherent disturbances and the statistical modeling of turbulence is required because turbulence, by far its nature, is stochastic. Determining the accurate unsteady response of airfoil is crucial for noise prediction. The primary goal of the project is to develop a new low-cost and easy-to-use numerical technique for aero-acoustic designs, focused primarily on airfoil-turbulence interaction. The development of the statistical method is divided into three sections; namely - 1) calculating the background flow, 2) modeling of statistically optimized inflow disturbance, 3) constructing a vortex database to predict the noise in multiple flow fields characterized by different values of turbulent intensities and length scales. In the framework of this work a new approach to model inflow turbulence, a significant noise-generating element, is suggested, which does not depend on heavy computations requiring supercomputers. Through this approach, the influence of turbulence parameters on the noise generated in turbomachinery can be quantified. The approach also considers the geometrical parameters of the airfoil in the noise prediction. The background flow is numerically simulated via solving the vorticity transport equations in the Lagrangian form (vortex methods). The acoustic influence of a finite number of vortices, characterized by all the possible combinations of size, circulation and injection position/time defined using the ranges of probability distribution functions, released from injection points upstream of the airfoil are precomputed and stored in a matrix. The method is computationally inexpensive compared to classical vortex methods since the effect due to particles are precomputed, stored in a/an matrix/array. The matrix can be called as a library while predicting the noise from a specific airfoil.",,"Sharma, Sparsh",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-5085,,OPUS4-5085,Dissertation
Computing the trajectories for the development of optimal routes,,"Planning the construction of new transport routes or power lines on terrain is usually carried out manually by engineers, with no guarantee of optimality. We introduce a new approach for the computation of an optimal trajectory for the construction of new transit routes and power lines between two locations on a submanifold U _ R3 representing the topography of a terrain. U is approximatively modeled by a special weighted grid. On this grid, the shortest paths for the construction of new routes are determined, whereby we consider three optimization criteria: routes with minimum distance, routes with lowest construction costs and routes with minimum absolute altitude variations or minimum absolute gradients. Subsequently, a combination of these criteria is used to expand this problem into a multi-criteria optimization problem. A shortest path algorithm, such as the Dijkstra algorithm, is used to compute optimal compromises for the construction of new routes.",,"Zazai, M.

Dealing with time in the multiple traveling salesmen problem with moving targets,,"The multiple traveling salesmen problem with moving targets is a generalization of the classical traveling salesmen problem, where the targets (cities or objects) are moving over time. Additionally, for each target a visibility time window is given. The task is to find routes for several salesmen so that each target is reached exactly once within its visibility time window and the sum of all traveled distances of all salesmen is minimal. We present different modeling formulations for this TSP variant. The time requirements are modeled differently in each approach. Our goal is to examine what formulation is most suitable in terms of runtime to solve the multiple traveling salesmen problem with moving targets with exact methods. Computational experiments are carried out on randomly generated test instances to compare the different modeling approaches. The results for large-scale instances show, that the best way to model time requirements is to directly insert them into a formulation with discrete time steps.",,"Stieber, Anke; Fügenschuh, Armin",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-4824,,OPUS4-4824,Bericht
A new heuristic and an exact approach for a production planning problem,,"We deal with a very complex and hard scheduling problem. Several types of products are processed by a heterogeneous resource set, where resources have different operating capabilities and setup times are considered. The processing of the products follows different workflows, allowing also assembly lines. The goal is to process all products in minimum time, i.e., the makespan is to be minimized. Because of the complexity of the problem an exact solver would require too much running time. We propose a compound method where a heuristic is combined with an exact solver. Our proposed heuristic is composed of several phases applying different smart strategies. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the exact approach, we exploit the makespan determined by the heuristic as an upper bound for the time horizon, which has a direct in uence on the instance size used in the exact approach. We demonstrate the efficiency of our combined method on multiple problem classes. With the help of the heuristic the exact solver is able to obtain an optimal solution in a much shorter amount of time.",,"Auer, Peter; Dósa, György; Dulai, Tibor; Fügenschuh, Armin; Näser, Peggy; Ortner, Ronald; Werner-Stark, Ágnes",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-4827,,OPUS4-4827,Bericht
An iterative graph expansion approach for the scheduling and routing of airplanes,,"A tourism company that offers fly-in safaris is faced with the challenge to route and schedule its fleet of airplanes in an optimal way. Over the course of a given time horizon several groups of tourists have to be picked up at airports and flown to their destinations within a certain time-window. Furthermore the number of available seats, the consumption of fuel, the maximal takeoff weight, and restrictions on the detour of the individual groups have to be taken into account. The task of optimally scheduling the airplanes and tour groups belongs to the class of vehicle routing problems with pickup and delivery and time-windows. A flow-over-flow formulation on the time expanded graph of the airports was used in the literature in order to model this problem as a mixed integer linear program. Most of the benchmark problems however could not be solved within a time limit of three hours, which was overcome by formulating the problem for a simplified (time-free) graph and the use of an incumbent callback to check for feasibility in the original graph. While this approach led to very good results for instances, where few time-free solutions were infeasible for the original problem, some instances remained unsolved. In order to overcome this problem we derive two new exact formulations that include time as variables. Although these formulations by themselves are not better than the approach from the literature, they allow for an effective construction of graphs which can be interpreted as intermediate graphs between the graph of airports and the expanded graph with vertices for each visit. Using similar relaxation techniques to the time-free approach and constructing these graphs based on solutions of the relaxations guarantees that only critical airports are expanded. A computational study was performed in order to compare the new formulations to the methods from the literature. Within a time limit of 3 hours the new approach was able to find proven optimal solutions for all previously unsolved benchmark instances. Furthermore the average computation time of all benchmark instances was reduced by 90 percent.",,"Gnegel, Fabian; Fügenschuh, Armin",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-4806,,OPUS4-4806,Bericht
Stable honeycomb structures and temperature based trajectory optimization for wire-arc additive manufacturing,,"We consider two mathematical problems that are connected and occur in the layer-wise production process of a workpiece using Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing. As the first task, we consider the automatic construction of a honeycomb structure, given the boundary of a shape of interest. In doing this we employ Lloyd's algorithm in two different realizations. For computing the incorporated Voronoi tesselation we consider the use of a Delaunay triangulation or alternatively, the eikonal equation. We compare and modify these approaches with the aim of combining their respective advantages. Then in the second task, to find an optimal tool path guaranteeing minimal production time and high quality of the workpiece, a mixed-integer linear programming problem is derived. The model takes thermal conduction and radiation during the process into account and aims to minimize temperature gradients inside the material. Its solvability for standard mixed-integer solvers is demonstrated on several test-instances. The results are compared with manufactured workpieces.",,"Bähr, Martin; Buhl, Johannes; Radow, Georg; Schmidt, Johannes; Bambach, Markus; Breuß, Michael; Fügenschuh, Armin",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-5079,,OPUS4-5079,Arbeitspapier
Low latency reconfiguration mechanism for fine-grained processor internal functional units,,"The strive for performance, low power consumption, and less chip area have been diminishing the reliability and the time to fault occurrences due to wear out of electronic devices. Recent research has shown that functional units within processors usually execute a different amount of operations when running programs. Therefore, these units present different individual wear out during their lifetime. Most existent schemes for re-configuration of processors due to fault detection and other processor parameters are done at the level of cores which is a costly way to achieve redundancy. This paper presents a low latency (approximately 1 clock cycle) software controlled mechanism to reconfigure units within processor cores according to predefined parameters. Such reconfiguration capability delivers features like wear out balance of processor functional units, configuration of units according to the criticality of tasks running on an operating system and configurations to gain in performance (e.g. parallel execution) when possible. The focus of this paper is to show the implemented low latency reconfiguration mechanism and highlight its possible main features.",,"Segabinazzi Ferreira, Raphael; Nolte, Jörg",2019,10.1109/LATW.2019.8704560,"10.1109/TC.2015.2449840, 10.1109/DSN-W.2016.57, 10.1109/DDECS.2017.7934572, 10.1109/LATW.2018.8349676, 10.1109/92.678870, 10.1109/DFT.2017.8244440, 10.1109/ASPDAC.2016.7428082, 10.1109/JSSC.2012.2220912, 10.1145/1151374.1151391, 10.1007/978-3-642-00641-8_31, 10.1109/TCAD.2016.2611501, 10.1109/RTAS.2015.7108449, 10.1109/VLSISOC.2006.313256, 10.1109/MC.2005.70, 10.1109/MDAT.2017.2750902, 10.1109/TDSC.2007.70235, 10.1109/FPL.2010.88, 10.1109/FPL.2011.65, 10.1109/TEST.2013.6651926, 10.1109/FPL.2013.6645497, ",OPUS4-5049,Konferenzveröffentlichung
Identification of phosphate adsorption mechanisms on Fe- and Al-hydroxides and the influence of inorganic and organic compounds to reduce long-term phosphorus fixation on mineral surfaces,,"With regard to the depletion of global phosphorus reserves and with the aim of ensuring sustainable soil fertility on agricultural soils, a fundamental understanding of mechanisms of fixation and mobilization of inorganic phosphorus in soils is required. Amongst others, phosphorus availability is affected by ad- and desorption reactions on pedogenic Fe- and Al-hydroxide surfaces. The characterization of phosphate binding on those contrasting mineral surfaces can help to find solutions for enhancing the mobilization of fertilized but not available soil inorganic phosphate. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic experiments were carried out during phosphorus adsorption on crystalline gibbsite, poorly crystalline 2-line-ferrihydrite and amorphous Fe:Al-hydroxide mixtures. Desorption experiments with CaCl&#8322;, CaSO&#8324;, citric acid (C&#8326;H&#8328;O&#8327;), and humic acid (C&#8329;H&#8329;NO&#8326;) were conducted to determine the capacity of phosphate fixation and mobilization in short- and long-term. Additionally, phosphorus release from the Fe- and Ca-phosphates vivianite and hydroxyapatite were analyzed. For gibbsite, the formation of AlHPO&#8324; and Al&#8322;HPO&#8324; can be assumed, while for ferrihydrite, a FeHPO&#8324; or Fe&#8322;PO&#8324; complex and the precipitation of FePO&#8324; with longer equilibration time were observed. Fe&#8322;HPO&#8324; or a Fe&#8322;PO&#8324; surface complex was deduced for amorphous Fe-hydroxides, an AlH&#8322;PO&#8324; surface complex was identified for Al-hydroxides. The weakly associated amorphous FeO(OH) molecules enhance the precipitation of FePO&#8324;. With high Al content, a weaker phosphate binding of both inner- and outer-sphere complexes and either no or minor quantities of precipitate were formed. Ferrihydrite showed a more rigid structure and a lower extent of precipitation compared to amorphous Fe-hydroxide. The cumulative phosphorus desorption followed the order CaCl&#8322; < CaSO&#8324; < humic acid < citric acid for crystalline and amorphous Fe- and Al-hydroxides as well for vivianite and hydroxyapatite. While inorganic anion exchange took part at easily available binding sites and fast exchangeable phosphorus, organic acids additionally affect the more heavily available binding sites and slow exchangeable phosphorus. For humic acid, the accumulation of metal-organic complexes in the desorption solution was suggested, whereas for citric acid the dissolution of the minerals was maintained. The cumulative release rates of the Flow-Through-Reactor setup were higher compared to batch due to a short residence time and a continuous concentration gradient. This could lead either to an over- or underestimation of the available phosphorus pools and influenced the comparability of both methods.",,"Gypser, Stella",2019,,,OPUS4-5131,Dissertation
Hidden conservation revealed : new media for the presentation of architectural conservation,,"Conservation work on cultural heritage occurs mostly 'behind the scenes', hidden away from the general public. Research has shown, however, that there is considerable interest from tourists and locals alike to gain insights into conservation practice. While this can be done through visits to conservation laboratories or heritage sites, an additional tool to complement these visits is to provide documentary films of ongoing conservation work. In the summer of 2016, a group of international master's students from different study programmes at Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg visited Florence to study issues related to the preservation of cultural heritage. In particular, they examined conservation-related work being done at the Courtyard of Michelozzo in the Palazzo Vecchio, where Giorgio Vasari originally decorated the upper wall sections and ceiling with frescoes in 1565. Due to daily wear and tear, which has been exacerbated by a high number of visitors as well as climatic conditions, conservation work became necessary to address soiled painted surfaces, disintegrating plaster and missing sections of the plaster and paint layers. This collection of papers addresses a variety of topics relating to the wall paintings by Vasari, as well as threats and tools to protect and conserve them and other cultural heritage sites that are faced with growing tourism. This student project was carried out in collaboration with the UNESCO Office of the Municipality of Florence (Carlo Francini and Chiara Bocchio), the Fine Arts Department of the Municipality of Florence (Giorgio Caselli), the director of the conservation work (Fabio Sforzi), wall painting conservators of the Vasari frescoes (Cristina Conti and Alessandra Popple), the Department of Architectural Conservation at Università di Firenze (Giuseppe Centauri and Daniela Chiesi) and the BTU Media Centre (Ralf Schuster).",,,2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-5063,,OPUS4-5063,Buch (Monographie)
A solution framework for linear PDE-constrained mixed-integer problems,,"We present a general numerical solution method for control problems with PDE-defined state variables over a finite set of binary or continuous control variables. We show empirically that a naive approach that applies a numerical discretization scheme to the PDEs (and if necessary a linearization scheme) to derive constraints for a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) leads to systems that are too large to be solved with state-of-the-art solvers for MILPs, especially if we desire an accurate approximation of the state variables. Our framework comprises two techniques to mitigate the rise of computation times with increasing discretization level parameters: First, the linear system is solved for a basis of the control space in a preprocessing step. Second, certain constraints are just imposed on demand via the IBM ILOG CPLEX feature of a lazy constraint callback. These techniques are compared with an approach where the relations obtained by the discretization of the continuous constraints are directly included in the MILP. We demonstrate our approach on two examples: modeling of the spread of wildfire and the mitigation of water contamination. In both examples the computational results demonstrate that the solution time is significantly reduced by our methods. In particular, the dependence of the computation time on the size of the spatial discretization of the PDE is significantly reduced.",,"Gnegel, Fabian; Fügenschuh, Armin; Hagel, Michael; Leyffer, Sven; Stiemer, Marcus",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-5045,,OPUS4-5045,Bericht

Mission planning for unmanned aerial vehicles,,"We formulate the mission planning problem for a meet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). The problem asks for a selection of targets from a list to the UAVs, and trajectories that visit the chosen targets. To be feasible, a trajectory must pass each target at a desired maximal distance and within a certain time window, obstacles or regions of high risk must be avoided, and the fuel limitations must be obeyed. An optimal trajectory maximizes the sum of values of all targets that can be visited, and as a secondary goal, conducts the mission in the shortest possible time. In order to obtain numerical solutions to this model, we approximate the MINLP by a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and apply a state-of-the-art solver (GUROBI) to the latter on a set of test instances.",,"Fügenschuh, Armin; Müllenstedt, Daniel; Schmidt, Johannes",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-4828,,OPUS4-4828,Bericht
"Participatory management of community-based ecotourism at Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve, China",,"Community-based ecotourism (CBET) is promoted in protected areas of developing countries as a strategy for biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. The success of CBET initiatives relies on effective participatory management programs that can build up collaborative relationships between key stakeholders - protected area administrative staff and local communities - and foster community empowerment. The performance of CBET participatory management programs, relationships between administrative staff and local community, and the level of community empowerment were previously assessed from the perspective of local communities. This study addresses both the perspectives of local community members and administrative staff, through an interview survey in Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve, China. This reserve is a key protected area for the conservation of giant panda and other endangered species in China, and is therefore of high priority for the national biodiversity strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to survey 200 local Tibetan villagers and 80 administrative staff members. The results indicate that both staff members and locals support the existing participatory management program - ecotourism development plan (EDP), but locals criticized the sustainable management policy (SMP). Younger, better educated and higher income interviewees were generally most supportive of the EDP and SMP. The relationship between staff members and locals was expressed as problematic with a lack of trust being mentioned as a key issue. The local community is empowered to some extent in economic and environmental dimensions, but not in social, psychological and political dimensions. The CBET generates economic income, but creates problems like inequality of benefit distribution, insufficient social infrastructure, loss of cultural identity, ecological degradation and participation as tokenism. Key factors that hinder the success of CBET from protected area governance and management aspects are a prevalent top-down approach, a mixture of property and operation rights, single sources of funding creating dependencies, a lack of efficient administrative structure and management capacity, and a lack of capacity building programs for the local community. This thesis provides empirical evidence for issues and limitations of policy implications under CBET participatory management programs in a protected area and offers recommendations on how to improve programs in the future.",,"Yang, Xueyan",2019,,,OPUS4-4846,Dissertation
"Development of single-stage solar-supported hyper-thermophilic anaerobic reactor for biogas production and disinfection of black water : a pilot case study of Terterkessim slum, Elmina - Ghana",,"Rapid urbanisation in Ghana has resulted in individuals expanding the cities for abodes without considerations of the negative externalities these may have on the environment. One of the major challenges with rapid urbanisation is the formation of urban slums associated with lack of basic sanitation facilities. This has led to recurrent outbreak of cholera and typhoid fever. The use of a single-stage solar-supported hyper-thermophilic anaerobic biogas digester for the treatment of black water has not been investigated, hence this study. The performance of three seeding sludge under three different hyper-thermophilic temperatures (60°C, 65°C and 70°C) were tested in batch tests. The three seeding sludge were sewage sludge, sludge from maize silage and cow manure. The results from the batch tests showed cow manure at 65°C as the preferred seeding sludge and optimal hyper-thermophilic temperature. A 50 L single-stage laboratory-scale hyper-thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor (HT-CSTR) was operated to treat only black water for 10 weeks using cow manure at 65°C as the seeding sludge and optimal hyper-thermophilic temperature. Afterwards, co-digestion of blended kitchen food waste and black water was also practised for 12 weeks. With a mean hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 23.3 days, a mean total COD removal of 86.3 % was achieved. The reactor had an average COD volumetric loading rate of 6.22 kgCOD/(m3.d) and remained uninhibited. It also had organic loading rate of 0.3 kgVS/(m3.d) and a degradation performance (R) of 5.43 kgCOD/(m3.d). Treatment of only black water produced biogas with less methane content of 34.9 % even though a stable pH of 6.9 was recorded both in the reactor and in the effluent. Co-digestion with kitchen food waste increased the percentage content of methane in the biogas by 77 % from 34.9 % to 61.8 %. The effectiveness of the HT-CSTR to hygienise the effluent for agricultural purpose was assessed by spiking the reactor with 200 ml each of 2 x 109 CFU/ml Salmonella senftenbergensis and 8 x 108 CFU/ml Escherichia coli. The HT-CSTR was able to hygienise all bacteria of Salmonella senftenbergensis and E. coli. A simulation test confirmed that between 30 minutes and 1 hour, all the cells of Salmonella senftenbergensis and E. coli in the treatment system were killed at 65 °C. Eubacteria, Methanosarcina spp., Methanomicrobium spp. and Methanococcus spp. were identified in the seeding sludge at the hyper-thermophilic temperature of 65°C. The design, construction and performance of a pilot-scale reactor in Terterkessim slum in Elmina, Ghana was based on results from the laboratory-scale HT-CSTR. It achieved 97 % removal of influent total COD and could produce about 2.52 Nm³CH&#8324;/(kgCOD.d) which could be burned for at least 8 hours. The effluent cannot be used for cultivation of leafy vegetables such as cabbage since it had some concentrations of pathogens like Salmonella spp. and E. coli but can be used for cotton crop.",,"Bryant, Isaac Mbir",2019,,,OPUS4-4781,Dissertation
Configurable Fault Tolerant Circuits and System Level Integration for Self-Awareness,,"Scaling minimum features of ICs down to the 10nm- area and below has allowed high integration rates in electronics. Scaling at supply voltages of 1V and below also implies a rising level of stress which drives aging effects that reduce switching speed and the expected life time. Additionally, vulnerability from particle radiation is increased. Hence, fault detection and on-line correction become a must for many applications. However, not only fault tolerance but self-awareness becomes also an advantage. Provided that by being aware of its own healthy state allow optimized configurations regarding system operation modes and configurable hardware mechanism. This paper shows a preliminary work in a configurable circuit and explores its configuration possibilities when integrated into a complete system.",,"Segabinazzi Ferreira, Raphael; George, Nevin; Chen, Junchao; Hübner, Michael; Krstic, Milos; Nolte, Jörg; Vierhaus, Heinrich Theodor",2019,10.26127/BTUOpen-5050,,OPUS4-5050,Konferenzveröffentlichung
Digital humanity: the temporal and semantic structure of dynamic conversational facial expressions,,"This thesis focuses on establishing a - theoretically founded and empirically derived - novel methodological pipeline to provide Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) with natural facial expressions and desired personality traits. After giving an overview on the content of this thesis, we dedicate its second part to derive the Semantic Space (SSp) for facial expressions, finding that the same space is used for expression words, expression videos, and motion-capture-based point-cloud animations. The process involved the creation of a new facial expression database using Motion Capture (MoCap) technology. Our technique can be used to empirically map specific motion trajectories (including their frequency-decomposition) onto specific perceptual attributes, allowing the targeted creation of novel animations with the desired perceptual traits, as exemplified in the third part of this thesis. Before addressing our final conclusions and, on the grounds that the systematic differences between individuals while performing the same facial expressions are related to their personality, we devote the fourth part of this thesis to the study of the mapping between personality and expressive facial motions.",,"Castillo Alejandre, Susana",2019,,,OPUS4-5156,Dissertation
Elucidating the role of DFS70/LEDGF/p75 in DNA damage response using CRISPR/Cas9 technology,,"Lens epithelium derived growth factor (LEDGF), is known to be overexpressed in different solid cancers and cancer cell lines but is also involved in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and diverse inflammatory diseases. Due to its chromatin-binding ability, it acts as a transcriptional coactivator, promoting anti-apoptotic pathways leading to increased tumor aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance. In this thesis, the role of LEDGF in laryngeal cancer cells was investigated. Thus, a knock-out of LEDGF in HEp-2 cells was successfully generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Moreover, LEDGF-deficient HEp-2 cells exhibited a decreased proliferation and migration, as well as an increased chemotherapy sensitivity towards topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. The DNA damage response was in more detail investigated, where LEDGF depleted cells showed a drastic reduction in the recruitment of downstream damage-response related proteins, more precisely replication protein A subunit of 32kDa (RPA32), and an increased amount of DNA fragmentation, highlighting the role of LEDGF in homology-directed DNA repair. In addition, a efficient method was established to allow genomic tagging of LEDGF at its C-terminus with EGFP which enables the monitoring of LEDGF in living cells. Therefore, an efficient Cas9-mediated DNA DSB induction was supplemented with a DNA template containing homology arms to the C-terminus as well as the EGFP sequence to allow homology-directed repair. Subsequently, EGFP-expressing cells were FACS sorted and single cells expanded. Almost all test clones showed a homozygous genotype for LEDGF-EGFP fusion which exhibited the typical nuclear pattern of LEDGF.",,"Liedtke, Victoria",2019,,,OPUS4-5591,Masterarbeit / Diplomarbeit
Sacred Limestone Caves : Management and the use of sacred heritage places in limestone cave areas along the Swahili Coast of Indian Ocean in Tanzania,,"Tanzania is the land which has extensive Limestone Caves along the Swahili Coast of East Africa. Many of these Limestone Caves believed to be formed about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic age when these areas were underwater. For a long time, Swahili communities along the coast of East Africa used the Limestone Caves as the places of worship, praying and conducting ritual practices. These Limestone Caves have been regarded as the Mosques, Churches or Temples by these Swahili communities who have been associated with the Caves for a long time before colonial time in 17th-19th Century. After independence in 1961, the Tanzanian government took over many of the Limestone Caves to manage and protect them as the national heritage under the Antiquities Divisions and other heritage governing bodies. However, in Tanzania the protection of Limestone Caves as Sacred Heritage Places have been only through modern laws which were inherited from colonial masters and are yet to produce satisfactory results on the best practice of these places, even after amendments. Other problems facing Sacred Heritage Places in Tanzania are lack of management plans, lack of freedom in worship and failure of Antiquities legislation to recognise traditional beliefs. These problems led to growing concern of different stakeholders regarding the government strategy to ensure prescriptions for best practices of the Sacred Heritage Places in Limestone Cave areas regarding the use, management and conservation. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to examine the use and management of Sacred Heritage Places along the Swahili Coast of the Indian Ocean in Tanzania. Data were obtained through focus group discussions, interviews and observations while legal documents were reviewed and analysed using thematic analysis to investigate research themes. The results indicated that there were ritual practices, strict taboos and customary laws used to control access into the Limestone Cave area but tourism and research activities have interfered with the sacred space creating a disconnect between the local communities and their heritage. This disconnection has driven people from their traditional religions into religions like Christianity and Islam. Finally, the thesis proposes MTRCC Framework for a heritage plan for best practice in Sacred Heritage Place in Limestone Cave areas; to be adopted by the Tanzanian Antiquities Divisions and other heritage management authorities to ensure that local communities have access to spaces crucial to their religious life. Also, MTRCC Framework ensures that there are no conflicts or interference from tourism, education and research activities that could result in negative effects for the heritage sites and stakeholders can have equal opportunities to experience these places.",,"Chami, Maximilian",2019,,,OPUS4-5108,Dissertation
Irreversible multi-scale diffusions: time scales and model reduction,,"In this work, we consider non-reversible multi-scale stochastic processes, described by stochastic differential equations, for which we review theory on the convergence behaviour to equilibrium and mean first exit times. Relations between these time scales for non-reversible processes are established, and, by resorting to a control theoretic formulation of the large deviations action functional, even the consideration of hypo-elliptic processes is permitted. The convergence behaviour of the processes is studied in a lot of detail, in particular with respect to initial conditions and temperature. Moreover, the behaviour of the conditional and marginal distributions during the relaxation phase is monitored and discussed as we encounter unexpected behaviour. In the end, this results in the proposal of a data-based partitioning into slow and fast degrees of freedom. In addition, recently proposed techniques promising accelerated convergence to equilibrium are examined and a connection to appropriate model reduction approaches is made. For specific examples this leads to either an interesting alternative formulation of the acceleration procedure or structural insight into the acceleration mechanism. For the model order reduction technique of effective dynamics, which uses conditional expectations, error bounds for non-reversible slow-fast stochastic processes are obtained. A comparison with the reduction method of averaging is undertaken, which, for non-reversible processes, possibly yields different reduced equations. For Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes sufficient conditions are derived for the two methods (effective dynamics and averaging) to agree in the infinite time scale separation regime. Additionally, we provide oblique projections which allow for the sampling of conditional distributions of non-reversible Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.",,"Neureither, Lara",2019,,,OPUS4-5046,Dissertation
Stochastic models in financial risk management,,"This thesis is concerned with stochastic models to manage financial risks. The first part deals with market risk and considers an investor facing a classical portfolio problem of optimal investment in log-Brownian stocks and a fixed-interest bond, but constrained to choose portfolio and consumption strategies which reduce the corresponding shortfall risk. Risk limits are formulated in terms of Value at Risk, Tail Conditional Expectation and Expected Loss and are dynamically imposed on the strategy as a risk constraint. The resulting stochastic optimal control problem is tackled using the dynamic programming approach. For both continuous-time and discrete-time financial markets the loss in expected utility of intermediate consumption and terminal wealth caused by imposing a dynamic risk constraint is investigated. The presented numerical results indicate that the loss of portfolio performance is not too large while the risk is notably reduced. Furthermore, the loss resulting from infrequent trading due to time discretization effects is typically bigger than the loss of portfolio performance resulting from imposing a risk constraint. The second part deals with credit risk and sets up a first-passage model of corporate default risk. The default event is specified in terms of the evolution of the total value of the firm's asset and the default barrier. Short-term default risk is incorporated by modeling the default barrier at which the firm is liquidated as a random variable which is time-dependent and allowed to switch. This setup combines the two classical modeling approaches and enables to model changes in the economy or the appointment of a new firm management. Different information levels on the firm's assets are distinguished and explicit formulas for the conditional default probability given the accessible information are derived. The impact of asymmetric information on the default probability and credit yield spread is investigated. Numerical results are presented indicating that the information on the firm value has a considerable impact on the estimate of the conditional survival probability and the associated credit yield spread.",,"Redeker, Imke",2019,,,OPUS4-4801,Dissertation

X-ray spectroscopic study of heterostructure contacting schemes for optoelectronic devices,,"Annealing-induced solid phase crystallization of In&#8322;O&#8323;:H leads to a significantly improved electron mobility, which is confirmed by Hall measurements. Indium hydroxide dehydroxylation occurs in In&#8322;O&#8323;:H during annealing, which is well responsible for the structural transformation and a high electron mobility with a decreased carrier concentration in crystallized In&#8322;O&#8323;:H. A significant decrease in the intensity of occupied gap states is observed in crystallized In&#8322;O&#8323;:H, possibly due to a decrease in carrier concentration. Doped In&#8322;O&#8323; variants have been found to have a quite deeper allowed transition level below the valence-band edge than undoped In&#8322;O&#8323;, which in particular applies to crystallized In&#8322;O&#8323;:H, but most likely attributed to a change of the crystal structure upon annealing and/or a different O 2p-In 4d coupling near the VBM compared to amorphous In&#8322;O&#8323;:H. To well understand the interface properties of Ag/In&#8322;O&#8323;:H upon annealing, a thin Ag film was grown on the In&#8322;O&#8323;:H substrate and annealed in vacuum up to 300 °C. During annealing, the potential Ag diffusion into the bulk In&#8322;O&#8323;:H and/or a change of an annealing-induced Ag topography (i.e., cluster formation) occurs, with a small Ag oxidation (i.e., Ag&#8322;O and AgO). With Ag deposition, an initial downward band bending of (0.11±0.05) eV was present in In&#8322;O&#8323;:H, attributed to a Schottky contact formed at the Ag/In&#8322;O&#8323;:H interface. Upon annealing, the downward band bending reduces gradually, and the Schottky-barrier height at the Ag/In&#8322;O&#8323;:H interface also decreases. A thickness series of the individual materials on the respective ""substrate"" (i.e., MnS/Si, GaN/MnS, and ZnO/GaN) was epitaxially grown on Si (100) wafer, and the interfacial chemistry and energy-level alignment at the respective interfaces are examined using photoelectron spectroscopy. At the MnS/Si interface, an interface-induced band bending (IIBB) appears in Si, which of values are found to be (0.15±0.07) and (0.23±0.07) eV for 4 and 15 nm MnS/Si stacks, respectively. The MnS/Si heterointerface shows a type-II (staggered) band lineup with a VBO of (-0.37±0.10) eV and the corresponding CBO of (2.27±0.10) eV. For the GaN/MnS interface, a significant diffusion of Mn into the GaN layer takes place during GaN deposition. In addition, an interface-induced band bending (IIBB) by ~0.30 eV is observed in MnS. The GaN/MnS interface shows a type-II (staggered) band lineup with a VBO of (1.46±0.10) eV and the corresponding CBO of (-1.09±0.10) eV. At the ZnO/GaN interface, a significant N diffusion from GaN into ZsnO takes place, i.e., Zn-N bonds, when ZnO is grown on the GaN layer. Also, an interfacial oxide (GaOx) layer was formed during ZnO deposited on GaN films. The ZnO/GaN heterointerface shows a type-II (staggered) band lineup with a VBO of (2.48±0.10) eV and the corresponding CBO of (-2.50±0.10) eV, respectively.",,"Xiao, Ting",2019,,,OPUS4-4939,Dissertation
Forest conservation and management practices in Cameroon: Case study of Bimbia-Bonadikombo Community Forest and Takamanda National Park,,"Cameroon's forest is one of the richest ecosystems in the Congo Basin and in Africa as a whole in terms of its biodiversity. These forest types are currently subjected to multiple categories of threats. By enacting a new forestry law in 1994, the government of Cameroon intended to intensify efforts toward the protection and conservation of this rich biodiversity. This study aimed to compare two forest management systems, a state management system (the case of Takamanda National Park) and a community-based management system (the case of Bimbia- Bonadikombo Community Forest), to determine which management system better conserves and protects the forest against biodiversity loss. The study applied a methodological framework that made use of selected indicators and criteria to evaluate the extent of sustainability of the two forest management systems and challenges faced in implementing them. Both quantitative and qualitative results were realized through the administration of questionnaires, semi-structure interview and in-depth contents analysis of Law No.94-1 of 20th January 1994 that lays down forestry, wildlife and fisheries regulations and the 1996 Environmental Management Law that directs Cameroon's compliance to the international standard of protecting the environment.Results indicated that community-based system of forest management is a much more sustainable approach of forest management than a state management system. Based on the criterion of cultural values attributed to natural resources in the community-based management zone (Bimbia- Bonadikombo Community Forest), 78.2% of the local communities were more willing to protect biodiversity as opposed to 48.3% from state management zone (Takamanda National Park). This study found that the level of participation in the community-based management system was much more inclusive and transparent. On the other hand, in the state management system, a high level of corruption, lack of transparency, delayed and irregular salaries of forest guards and minimal participation of local communities in forest management decision-making was noted and likely responsible for the ineffectiveness and unsustainable management efforts in this system. The study recommends the adoption and implementation of a more inclusive, transparent and accountable management in the state managed system (Takamada national park), particularly the full involvement of respected Elites, Chiefs and Traditional Councils.",,"Nyambi Anaka, Regina Edawa",2018,10.26127/BTUOpen-5011,,OPUS4-5011,Dissertation
GaN HEMT modeling including trapping effects based on Chalmers model and pulsed S-parameter measurements,,"Although GaN HEMTs are regarded as one of the most promising RF power transistor technologies thanks to their high-voltage high-speed characteristics, they are still known to be prone to trapping effects, which hamper achievable output power and linearity. Hence, accurately and efficiently modeling the trapping effects is crucial in nonlinear large-signal modeling for GaN HEMTs. This work proposes a trap model based on an industry standard large-signal model, named Chalmers model. Instead of a complex nonlinear trap description, only four constant parameters of the proposed trap model need to be determined to accurately describe the significant impacts of the trapping effects, e.g., drain-source current slump, typical kink observed in pulsed I/V characteristics, and degradation of the output power. Moreover, the extraction procedure of the trap model parameters is based on pulsed S-parameter measurements, which allow to freeze traps and isolate the trapping effects from self-heating. The model validity is tested through small- and large-signal model verification procedures. Particularly, it is shown that the use of this trap model enables a dramatical improvement of the large-signal simulation results.",,"Luo, Peng",2018,,,OPUS4-4598,Dissertation
Anaerobic treatment of municipal organic waste from separate collection : digestate properties and substance flows during two-stage digestion and subsequent aerobic treatment,,"The provision of nutrients and organic matter to arable soils is critical to facilitate an intensive agriculture and secure long-term soil functionality. Municipal organic waste (MOW) is rich in nutrients and organic matter and its recycling onto agricultural lands presents a promising alternative to conventional fertilizers. In comparison to common aerobic treatment, the application of the biogas technology enables the recovery of both energy and soil amendments. The introduction of a mandatory separate collection in Germany in 2015 reflects the political will to increase MOW recovery rates and facilitates its utilization as feedstock in biogas plants. However, MOW is a challenging feedstock as its composition varies and it is often contaminated with impurities such as plastics and metals. The two-stage anaerobic digestion process with dry fermentation is very robust and offers possibilities for process control so that no extensive MOW pretreatment is required. To close nutrient circles, remaining digestates shall be processed to soil amendments, which can be redistributed to arable land. However, less is known about digestate properties from two-stage digestion of MOW and how they are influenced during the treatment process. Furthermore, only scarce information on nutrient recovery rates and the accumulation of elements during processing is available. Therefore, this thesis investigates the development of digestate properties during anaerobic and subsequent aerobic treatment at laboratory and semi-industrial scale. During a first experiment, changes in nutrient and heavy metal concentration in the solid digestate were monitored during anaerobic treatment of MOW in a two-stage laboratory biogas plant. A second investigation related amendment properties of MOW digestate of one origin to different post-treatment procedures. The impact of drying, composting and sieving on final digestate properties and specifically nutrient availability and heavy metal and carbon elution was evaluated. A third experimental approach investigated total material and substance flows during treatment of source-separated MOW in a semi-industrial scale two-stage biogas plant and subsequent digestate composting including impurities removal.",,"Knoop, Christine",2018,10.26127/BTUOpen-4820,,OPUS4-4820,Dissertation
Fine-grained transactions for NVRAM,,"For decades, there has been a distinction between fast, volatile and slow, non-volatile memory technologies in the storage hierarchy of computer systems. While volatile memories offer a byte addressable interface, persistence was limited to slower, block-oriented media. As a consequence, processing and storing information implies copying data from the persistent storage to volatile memory and vice versa. In recent years, a new memory technology which is both byte-addressable and non-volatile has been announced: Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM). Its unique combination of features allows processing of information exactly at the location where it is stored permanently, thereby eliminating the need for copies. Without the need to create and manage copies, data can be processed significantly faster. The processing of persistent information can be disrupted by failures, like crashes. When changes are only partially performed, data might be left in an inconsistent state. Such a situation can be avoided by creating a copy before starting to change data. That backup is restored when a failure has been detected. Such a procedure relies on a highly specific order of its operations, because the backup can only be disposed after all changes have been carried out successfully. Since NVRAM removes the need for accessing block-oriented media, it removes a major bottleneck in the processing of persistent information, especially when only small amounts of data are modified. As a result, controlling the order of operations dominates the processing performance. This thesis analyses transactional mechanisms for data on NVRAM which can guarantee that sequences of operations are either carried out as one unit or not at all. The idea is based on creating backups, as sketched above. Existing approaches for the traditional storage hierarchy use separate memory locations for backup and modified data. In a first step, the costs of applying existing procedures to NVRAM are identified. Afterwards, a novel approach which couples the versions tighter in space is presented. Enabled by the unique properties of NVRAM, this new approach is able to reduce the costs of ordering. The processing of persistent data can thereby be sped up significantly.",,"Traue, Jana",2018,,,OPUS4-4636,Dissertation
In-stream microbial carbon transformation under opposing stresses - drought and sediment transport,,"The mineralization of organic matter (OM) is an important ecosystem service that has come under pressure because of increased frequency of droughts and higher sediment loads in running waters. In particular, lowland streams in temperate regions may experience reinforced sediment transport through migratory ripples and changes of naturally sorted sand and gravel in streambeds towards sand-dominated, homogenized streambed structure. The impact on microbial carbon (C)-transformation from these changes was the main focus of my doctoral thesis, in particular the impact of (i) periodic mechanical disturbance associated with ripple migration (ii) streambed structure homogenization, and (iii) drought in streambeds with sorted or homogenized sediment structure. In a set of microcosms, the significance of periodic mechanical disturbances for microbial C-transformation was tested. Thereby, the quantity and quality of the OM in the sandy sediments were varied by the addition of leaves and fish feces to the OM-poor sands. The results revealed that periodic mechanical disturbances resulted in significant decrease in microbial respiration to a low and similar level regardless of OM quality contained in sand. The importance of the streambed structure (sorted vs homogenized) for C-transformation was tested using set of experimental streams. The focus was on the interaction between benthic and hyporheic microbial processes in C-transformation to better understand the consequences of streambed homogenization on microbial function. The results showed that sediment structure determines connectivity between the benthic and hyporheic zones. The lower water exchange in homogenized streambeds and thereby reduced supply of freshly produced bioavailable OM from the benthic to the hyporheic zone, curtailed microbial respiration in the latter affecting the water quality. The influence of a drought and rewetting was tested on C-transformation in streambeds with a sorted or homogenized sediment structure using experimental streams where one half of the streams were strongly shaded and the other half moderately shaded. The results showed that streambeds affected by droughts, either with sorted or homogenized sediment structure have a similar microbial activity at the first place controlled by shading, whereas microbial composition during drought and its recovery after rewetting was additionally affected by sediment structure. Overall, this doctoral thesis showed that in sediment transport- and drought-impacted streambeds (i) ripple migration results in decreased C-transformation regardless of the available quality of OM, (ii) homogenization of sorted sediment structure leads to a decrease in microbial C-transformation in the hyporheic zone, and (iii) interaction between sediment structure and shading alters microbial community composition especially critical for resistance and resilience of C-transformation during drought and rewetting.",,"Zlatanovi&#263;, Sanja",2018,,,OPUS4-4489,Dissertation
Statistical size effect in steel structure and corresponding influence on structural reliability,,"This thesis aims to investigate the statistical size effect in the elasto-plastic material and the corresponding reliability of steel structures. The core idea is that the stochastic material properties are directly embedded in mechanical calculations to develop a more accurate and economical design method for steel structure. Moreover, the results of the experimental investigation with different specimen sizes, whose diameter is limit up to 32 mm, show that the statistical size effect exists in steel structures. This thesis demonstrates finally that the structural reliability is affected by the statistical size effect and the structural safety can be optimized by considering this effect. Because of the uncertainty and non-uniformity of the microscopic imperfection distribution, the material strength in macroscale presents complex randomness. This study described the randomness of material properties through two different ways: developing a stochastic material model for elasto-plastic material and establishing a discrete random field with a general mathematical program. The proposed stochastic material model is extended to analyze the steel structure with multiaxial stress and is integrated into the commercial FEM software for analysis of the complex structures with stress gradient. The stochastic finite element method is implemented to analyze the response of the 3D structures by a general-purpose FEM program when the random field file is imported into the finite element model. The uniaxial tensile tests with different specimen sizes and different material are carried out to demonstrate the statistical size effect in steel structures. The results show that the variations of the yield and tensile strength increase with the decreasing specimen volume. Moreover, according to the bending tests, it is obvious that the structural component strength is not only related to the specimen volume, but also the stress distribution. These two proposed simulation methods, which are an extension and supplement to traditional simulation methods, can effectively simulate the statistical size effect for the tensile and flexural components in steel structures. Finally, it is found by studying the influence of statistical size effect on structural reliability that the strength, which is obtained by small specimens through statistical analysis in the laboratory, is no more accurately applicable to large construction. The reliability theory for the structural safety which exists over the decades can be compared and validated or improved through the embedding the stochastic material properties in the numerical simulation.",,"Li, Zheng",2018,,,OPUS4-4555,Dissertation

The morphology and local elemental composition of CH&#8323;NH&#8323;PbI&#8333;&#8323;&#8331;&#8339;&#8334;Cl&#8339;, used as absorbers in PV devices, defining the film quality and influencing the performance of respective solar cells is studied in detail by using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). An incomplete coverage, with holes reaching down to the c-TiO&#8322; was revealed; three different topological regions with different degrees of coverage and chemical composition were identified. Depending on the degree of coverage a variation in I oxidation and the formation of Pb&#8304; in the vicinity of the c-TiO&#8322; is found. The valence band maxima (VBM) derived from experimental data for the perovskite and c-TiO&#8322;, combined with information from literature on spiro-MeOTAD suggests an energy level alignment resulting in an excellent charge selectivity at the absorber/spiro-MeOTAD and absorber/c-TiO&#8322; interfaces respectively. Further, the derived energy level alignment indicates a large recombination barrier (~2 eV), preventing shunts due to direct contact between c-TiO&#8322; and spiro-MeOTAD in the pin-holes. In-situ ambient pressure hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-HAXPES) studies of 60 and 300 nm CH&#8323;NH&#8323;PbI&#8333;&#8323;&#8331;&#8339;&#8334;Cl&#8339; have been performed under varies conditions (i.e. vacuum/water and dark/UV light) to gain insight into the degradation mechanism responsible for the short lifetime of the absorber. The 60 nm perovskite forms Pb&#8304; in water vapor (non-defined illumination) in presence of x-rays. The 300 nm perovskite sample shows a complex behavior under illumination/dark. In water vapor/dark the perovskite dissolves into its organic (MAI) and inorganic (PbI&#8322;) components. Under illumination PbI&#8322; further decomposes to Pb&#8304; induced by UV light and x-rays. For alternative inorganic CsSnBr&#8323; perovskites, the impact of SnF&#8322; on the chemical and electronic structure is studied to identify its role for the improved performance of the solar cell. HAXPES and lab-XPS measurements performed on CsSnBr&#8323; with and without SnF&#8322; indicate two Sn, Cs, and Br species in all samples, where the second Sn species is attributed to oxidized Sn (Sn&#8308;&#8314;). When adding SnF&#8322; to the precursor solution, the coverage is improved and less Sn&#8308;&#8314; and Cs and Br secondary species can be observed, revealing an oxidation inhibiting effect of SnF&#8322;. Additionally, SnF&#8322; impacts the electronic structure, enhancing the density of states close to the VBM.",,"Hartmann, Claudia",2018,,,OPUS4-4635,Dissertation
"Repowering public utility grid by integrating hydro, PV and wind into the grid to supply electricity in Palu (Indonesia)",,"The use of renewable energy sources, either off-grid or on-grid to supply electricity, has been done by developed countries since many years ago. Developing countries, for example Indonesia especially east part of Indonesia have recently started this way whereas renewable energy potential for example hydro, PV and wind are abundantly available. The lack of research and data is one of the obstacles to precede the use of renewable energy in this area, meanwhile this area has electricity shortages problem that occurred quite often. Combined hydro, PV, wind, coal and diesel generators will solve electricity shortages problem in Palu (Indonesia). Integration of Hydro, PV and wind into PALAPAS utility grid will decrease levelized cost of energy from US$ 0.145 per kWh to US$ 0.133 per kWh. Sensitivity analysis against fluctuating fuel cost (from US$ 0.4 per litre to US$ 1.6 per litre) will increase levelized cost of energy before integrating renewable energy into the grid from US$ 0.145 per kWh to US$ 0.455 per kWh and will increase levelized cost of energy after integrating RE into the grid from US$ 0.133 per kWh to US$ 0.403 per kWh. Repowering grid with integrating hydro, PV and wind will increase power quality especially by using configuration based on homer results. Buses voltage and buses frequency showed better result before, during and after some faults based on Homer simulation results. Voltage spectrum and sinusoidal waveform voltage are showing less distortion after integrating hydro, PV and wind into the grid even with no distortion based on Homer results.",,"Dewi, Sari",2018,,,OPUS4-4547,Dissertation
Tax effects on asset prices,,"In this dissertation I treat questions of asset pricing under the presence of taxes. I present four published articles. The first three articles are concerned with topics of company valuation when debt is risky. The first article analyzes the applicable discount rate for the valuation of tax savings in a simple setting without taxes on cancelled debt. The article concludes that the discount rate of tax savings is the same as the one for interest payments. Other than frequently assumed, this discount rate is not necessarily the same as the discount rate for debt as a whole. With the prioritization of interest or principal payments in case of losses on debt payments, the discount rates on interest payments and of tax savings are regularly different from the one for the overall debt issue. Only a pro rata distribution of losses on principal and interest payments generally leads to equal discount rates for interest payments, principal payments, and, therefore, also for debt payments as a whole. The second article continues to look at the valuation of tax savings. It differentiates the case with and the one without the taxation of cancelled debt. For both cases, the article derives equations for the value of tax savings as well as for risk-adjusted discount rates and WACC-like equations. A major finding is that the previous corporate finance literature on this topic usually makes the implicit assumption that cancelled debt is taxed. In this case valuation equations have a simple form since they are independent from the distribution of losses between interest and principal payments. Without the taxation of cancelled debt, the distribution of losses on interest and principal payments becomes important for the valuation procedures and a differentiation between cases such as interest prioritization, principal prioritization and pro rata loss distribution is necessary. The third article uses the findings of the first two articles and constructs equations for a de- and re-levering procedure using the expected return equations from the mean-variance CAPM. It extends the regularly used procedure that uses the assumption of risk-free debt to simple settings with risky debt. The forth article looks at two economies, which differ only with respect to taxation - one features taxes on capital gains and one does not. The analysis leads to several extensions on prior findings on the question of the conditions under which asset prices are the same in both economies. The article provides sufficient conditions for unchanged prices for the case of a zero risk-free rate, which entails that all agents consume exactly the same in each state. Without a zero risk-free rate, prices are the same in both economies with exponential utility and normal returns and with linear marginal utility.",,"Krause, Marko Volker",2018,,,OPUS4-4964,Dissertation
Studio Bagan - building in heritage context,,"The report ""Studio Bagan: Building in Heritage Context"" presents an in-depth study of the issue of monument climbing at Bagan, one of Asia's most important Buddhist sites. Originally built during the 11th to 13th centuries the site comprises more than 3.000 Buddhist monuments ranging from small stupas and temples to monastic complexes and several enormous stucco-covered structures on an area of about 25 square kilometres. The core concept of the research project that resulted in the report was to work across the disciplines of architectural conservation, heritage studies and design. Thus, the study was conducted by academics of respective fields and master students of World Heritage Studies, architecture and urban planning. The project applied approaches from social sciences as applied in architectural conservation in order to guide the architectural design process. These included values-based approaches for gaining an understanding of the site and of the stakeholders' needs; heritage impact assessments to identify beneficial (and adverse) characteristics for potential alternative viewing platforms; typology exploration and location analysis through the SWOT process.",,,2018,,,OPUS4-4557,Buch (Monographie)
3D reconstruction using generalized perspective photometric stereo,,"Reconstruction of the 3D shape information is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Among different shape recovering technologies, photometric stereo is highlighted for its capability to produce high quality 3D reconstruction. This dissertation generalizes photometric stereo in different aspects towards creating a practical 3D reconstruction. The proposed techniques can be considered as a fundamental support to develop future cameras offering 3D shapes for various applications such as movie and video game industry, medical sciences, virtual reality, automotive driving and etc. The first generalization is developed for addressing specularities in 3D reconstructions and also involving the perspective projection. These attempts lead to remove the limitation of working with diffuse materials and confined projected scenes. We will prove the applicability of our approach using complex scenes like endoscopy images. In the second proposed approach, we will offer a real-time 3D reconstruction of micro-details with a more generalized reflectance model. Moreover, a recurrent optimization network will be provided. These innovations lead to presenting the 3D reconstruction of details which are even invisible to human eyes like micro-prints on the banknote. This information recovery can be used in various areas such as detecting security items on financial documents for fraud detection and also the quality control of any industrial productions including delicate details such as printed circuits. In the third proposed model, we develop a PS reconstruction technique using neural networks for the uncalibrated PS where the light direction is not available. Finally, for the first time, benefiting from deep neural networks and meta heuristic algorithms, we will devise an approach which can deliver high qualified 3D shape from the internet and out-door images, without any pre-necessary knowledge.",,"Khanian, Maryam",2018,,,OPUS4-4719,Dissertation
The influence of allylic site abstraction reactions of olefin on cyclo-paraffin formation,,"This thesis is a combined work of understanding the high temperature oxidation chemistry of cycloalkanes viz. methylcyclohexane based on previously developed cyclohexane and extending it to generate the larger n-propylcyclohexane chemical kinetic mechanism. The detailed kinetic reaction mechanism model for the oxidation of 1-hexene previously developed has been added to account for the ring opening of cyclohexane forming 1-hexene. As an update to the publication, preference of allylic H-abstractions from 1-hexene has been taken into account and retro-ene reaction producing propene has been added. The complete model is composed of 329 species and 2065 reactions with 3796 reversible elementary reactions. Further, these models have been validated against different experiments such as shock tubes, jet stirred reactors and laminar flames to cover full range of temperatures, pressures and equivalence ratios making the models comprehensive and was found to be adequate to satisfactorily reproduce the experimental data. The allylic radicals (C&#8326;H&#8321;&#8321;-D1R3) preferred abstractions from 1-hexene improves the C&#8326;H&#8321;&#8321; profiles in the 1-hexene model. But it also influences the otherwise isomerization path of C&#8326;H1&#8321;&#8321;-D1R6 to CYC&#8326;H&#8321;&#8321; (Cyclohexyl radical) which would further form cyclohexene (CYC&#8326;H&#8321;&#8320;). It is observed that CYC&#8326;H&#8321;&#8320; profiles in 1-hexene flames and cyclohexane speciation are over-predicted. The major decomposition pathway of the cycloalkanes is through H-abstractions on the ring. The path which leads towards ring opening to form olefin is observed for cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane but is very low. The fulvene pathway influence on benzene profiles of 1-hexene is obvious but do not seem to affect the cycloalkanes. This infers there are other benzene formation pathways in cycloalkanes. Some possible pathways would be the dehydrogenation of dienes and dehydrogenation of cyclo-olefins.",,"Nawdiyal, Amruta",2018,10.26127/BTUOpen-4852,,OPUS4-4852,Dissertation
Automated process for robust airfoil design-optimization incorporating critical eigenmode identification and production-tolerance evaluation,,"For many countries, gasturbine technology is one of the key technologies for the reduction of climate-damaging pollutant emissions. The profitability of such facilities, however, is highly dependent on the price for the utilized fossil fuel, which is why there is a constant need for increased efficiency. The potential of increasing the efficiency of the individual components is basically limited by factors which will reduce operating life. The goal of this thesis is to develop methods for improved automated structural design optimization, which shall be developed on the basis of compressor airfoils. Special attention is payed to avoid the excitation of failure critical eigenmodes by detecting them automatically. This is achieved by introducing a method based on self-organizing neural networks which enables the projection of eigenmodes of arbitrary airfoil geometries onto standard surfaces, thereby making them comparable. Another neural network is applied to identify eigenmodes which have been defined as critical for operating life. The failure rate of such classifiers is significantly reduced by introducing a newly developed initialization method based on principle components. A structural optimization is set up which shifts the eigenfrequency bands of critical modes in such a way that the risk of resonance with engine orders is minimized. In order to ensure practical relevance of optimization results, the structural optimization is coupled with an aerodynamic optimization in a combined process. Conformity between the loaded hot-geometry utilized by the aerodynamic design assessment and the unloaded cold-geometry utilized by the structural design assessment is ensured by using loaded-to-unloaded geometry transformation. Therefor an innovative method is introduced which, other than the established time-consuming iterative approach, uses negative density for a direct transformation taking only a few seconds, hence, making it applicable to optimization. Additionally, in order for the optimal designs to be robust against manufacturing variations, a method is developed which allows to assess the maximum production tolerance of a design from which onwards possible design variations are likely to violate design constraints. In contrast to the usually applied failure rate, the production tolerance is a valid requirement for suppliers w.r.t.~expensive parts produced in low-quantity, and therefore is a more suitable optimization objective.",,"Martin, Ivo",2018,,,OPUS4-4713,Dissertation
"Characterization of the performance of PEM water electrolysis cells operating with and without flow channels, based on experimentally validated semi-empirical coupled-physics models",,"PEM water electrolysis is a clean technology for hydrogen production. In spite of its many advantages, the costs of the conventional PEM electrolysis cell makes it commercially less competitive vis-à-vis its peers. An alternative cell design has been proposed which has up to a 25 % costs advantage over the conventional cell. In this alternative cell design, the flow channel plate which bears the most costs in the conventional cell design has been replaced with a 3-D Porous Transport Layer (PTL) structure. It has however, been observed that the conventional cell by far out performs the low cost cell at high current density operations, due to increased mass transport limitation in the later. Industrial and commercial hydrogen production efforts are focused towards high current density operation (> 3 A/cm²), so the alternative cell design must be optimized for mass transport limitation.

This work seeks to understand the source of, and to eliminate the mass transport losses in the alternative cell design to get it performing at least as good as the conventional cell at current densities up to 5 A/cm². A 2-D non-isothermal semi-empirical fully-coupled models of both cell designs have been developed and experimentally validated. The developed validated models were then used as tools to simulate and predict the best operating conditions, design parameters and micro-structural properties of the PTL at which the mass transport issues in the alternate cell will be at its minimum, at high current densities. The models are based on a multi-physics approach in which thermodynamic, electrochemical, thermal and mass transport sub-models are coupled and solved numerically, to predict the cell polarization and individual overpotentials, as well as address heat and water management issues. The most unique aspect of this work however, is the development of own semi-empirical equations for predicting the mass transport overpotential imposed by the gas phase (bubbles) at high current densities. For the very first time, calculated polarization curves up to 5 A/cm² have been validated by own experimental data. The results show that, the temperature and pressure, water flowrate and thickness of the PTL are the critical parameters for mitigating mass transport limitation. It was found that, for the size of the cells studied (25 cm² active area each), when both cells are operating at the same temperature of 60 °C, alternative design will have a comparable performance to the conventional designed cell even at 5 A/cm² current density when; the operating pressure is &#8805; 5 bar, the feed water flowrate is &#8805; 0.024l/min&#8729;cm², PTL porosity is 50 %, PTL pore size is &#8805; 11 µm and PTL thickness is 0.5 mm. At these operating, design and micro-structural conditions, the predicted difference between the polarizations of both cells will be only ~10 mV at 5 A/cm² operating current density.",,"Ojong, Emile Tabu",2018,,,OPUS4-4650,Dissertation
Towards ultrasensitive SPR-based sensing: self-referencing and detection of single nanoparticles,,"Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and its extensions, surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) and surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) both enabling visualization of the sensor surface, belong to classical, indispensable highly sensitive and robust optical (bio)analytical techniques to study affinity processes on a surface. Nevertheless, SPR and SPRi/SPRM undergo a continuous development in regard to the improvement of sensitivity. The main challenge in this direction is attributed to the separation of signals due to the binding of analytes and those due to the bulk effect. The main task of the present thesis was to apply different strategies to improve the performance of SPR sensing. Within this scope, two main objectives were pursued: (1) implementation and realization of a so-called internal referencing towards suppression of the bulk effect leading to an improvement and optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and (2) application of wide-field (WF)-SPRM to detect, to visualize and to characterize single nanoparticles adsorbed to modified surfaces. The first objective of this thesis comprises the realization of three different internal-referencing approaches. In the first approach, a self-referencing effect based on arbitrarily distributed micro-patterned self-assembled monolayer (SAM) containing sensing and referencing spots was realized. Measurements of classical antigen-antibody-interaction resulted in a 10-fold improvement of the SNR by suppression of the bulk effect and the corresponding microfluctuations of the bulk temperature. The application of the second internal-referencing-approach, ionic referencing, acting as an assessment of patterned SAM was realized using electrolytes with a high molar refraction of either anions or cations to micro-patterned SAM combined with WF-SPRM as detecting technology. As a result, successful, unobtrusive visualization and spatial distinction of micro-patterned surfaces was shown. Unlike visualization of micro-scaled surface areas, the application of spatio-temporal referencing in WF-SPRM, as a third type of internal referencing, enables to detect, moreover to visualize and localize, smallest changes in refractive index near/on the sensor surface. In that sense, the second objective of this thesis was dedicated to the application of the WF-SPRM technology combined with spatio-temporal referencing to detect, to visualize, to quantify and to characterize single nanoparticles adsorbed to the sensor surface; here, nanoparticles act as analyte species. Based on a sophisticated image analysis, successful detection and characterization of single nanoparticles in complex media such as wine, juice and sun cream was performed. Besides being a powerful solution for nanoparticles analytics, the WF-SPRM technology represents a base to develop novel, ultra-sensitive and fast (bio)sensing platforms. Within this scope, enzyme-assisted generation of nanoparticles was studied.",,"Scherbahn, Vitali",2018,,,OPUS4-4711,Dissertation
Simulation and assessment of engine knock events,,"Sophisticated engine knock modeling supports the optimization of the thermal efficiency of spark ignition engines. For this purpose the presented work introduces the resonance theory (Bradley and co-workers, 2002) for three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and for the zero-dimensional Spark Ignition Stochastic Reactor Model (SI-SRM) simulations. Hereby, the auto-ignition in the unburnt gases is investigated directly instead of the resulting pressure fluctuations. Based on the detonation diagram auto-ignition events can be classified to be in acceptable deflagration regime or possibly turn to a harmful developing detonation. Combustion is modeled using detailed chemistry and formulations for turbulent flame propagation. The use of detailed chemistry caters for the prediction of physical and chemical properties, such as the octane rating, C:H:O-ratio or dilution. For both models, the laminar flame speed is retrieved from surrogate specific look-up tables compiled using the reaction mechanism for Ethanol containing Toluene Reference Fuels by Seidel (2017). In the fresh gas zone, the scheme is used for auto-ignition prediction. For this purpose, the G-equation coupled with a Well-Stirred-Reactor model is applied in RANS. In analogy, in the SI-SRM the combustion is modeled using a two zone model with stochastic mixing between the particles. RANS is used to develop the knock classification methodology and to analyze in detail location, size and shape of the auto-ignition kernels. RANS estimates the ensemble average of the process and therefore cannot reproduce a developing detonation. Hence, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to verify the methodology. Studies using wide ranges of surrogates with different octane rating and cycle-to-cycle variations are carried out using the computationally efficient SI-SRM. Cyclic variations are predicted based on stochastic mixing, stochastic heat transfer to the wall, varying exhaust gas recirculation composition and imposed probability density functions for the inflammation time and the scaling of the mixing time retrieved from RANS. The methodology is verified for spark timing and octane rating. It is shown that the surrogate formulation has an important impact on knock prediction. RANS is suitable to predict the mean strength of auto-ignition in the unburnt gas if the thermodynamic and chemical state of the ignition kernel is analyzed instead of the pressure gradients. The probability of the transition to knocking combustion can be determined. Good agreement between RANS and SI-SRM are obtained. The combination of both tools gives insights of local effects using RANS and the distribution of auto-ignition in the whole pressure range of an operating point using SI-SRM with reasonable computationally cost for development purposes.",,"Netzer, Corinna",2018,,,OPUS4-4877,Dissertation

Linguistic interpretation of visual contents via Deep Learning,,"The main part of the research outlined in this thesis is to develop Deep Learning models for the linguistic interpretation of the visual contents. This part is split into two research problems: interactive region segmentation and captioning, and selective texture labeling. In the first attempt, we proposed a novel hybrid Deep Learning architecture whereby the user is able to specify an arbitrary region of the image that should be highlighted and described. The proposed model alternates the bounding box indications of the standard object localization process with the output of a deep interactive segmentation module to achieve a better understanding of the dense image captioning and improve the object localization accuracy. The idea of the next part is to establish a bidirectional correlation between deep texture representation and its linguistic description via a hybrid CNN-RNN model that enables end-to-end learning of the selective texture labeling. This novel architecture provides new opportunities to describe, search, and also retrieve texture images from their linguistic descriptions. To be able to train such a model, we generated a multi-label texture dataset that covers color, material, and pattern labeling simultaneously. Our contribution to the automatic generation of texture descriptions provides an excellent opportunity to enrich the existing vocabulary of the image captioning. Such a conceptual extension can be used for fine-grained captioning applicable in geology, meteorology and other natural sciences where fine-grained image structures are of importance to understand complicated patterns. Apart from Deep Learning technologies, in the final section of the thesis, we proposed a novel approach to define mathematical morphology on color images. To this end, we converted common RGB-values of the color images into a new biconal color space and then combined two approaches of mathematical morphology to give meaning to the maximum and the minimum of the matrix field data and formulate our novel strategy.",,"Sharifi Boroujerdi, Ali",2018,,,OPUS4-4718,Dissertation
What does it take to treat municipal wastewater in developing countries? An econometric analysis of Mexican municipalities,,"Water pollution is a major issue in developing countries. 2.2 of the 2.3 billion people who suffer annually from waterborne diseases live in this part of the world. Moreover, it causes the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems the living of billions of poor people depend on. A major source of water pollution is the discharge of untreated municipal wastewater. On average, cities in developing countries discharge 80-90% of their sewage untreated. Though treatment of municipal wastewater remains a huge challenge in developing countries, the situation is not equally adverse all over the place. Treatment rates vary substantially across localities. From this observation, the question arises what drives and what impairs wastewater treatment. No quantitative analysis of this topic has been performed yet at the municipal level in a developing country. Therefore, this thesis investigates the impact of social factors on municipal wastewater treatment in Mexican municipalities in order to gain insights on what improves wastewater treatment in a developing country. 846 of 2,456 Mexican municipalities treat a share of their municipal wastewater that ranges from single-digit percentages to full coverage while the majority of municipalities treats no wastewater. The study relies on econometric techniques to scrutinize 10 hypotheses on the relationship between social factors and wastewater treatment. More precisely, it applies binary outcome models to estimate the conditional probability wastewater treatment takes place in a municipality for a sample of 2,290 Mexican municipalities. In addition, it applies the Tobit and Fractional logit model to estimate the percentage of treated municipal wastewater depending on social factors for 425 municipalities. The thesis identifies geographic spillovers, environmental federalism, institutional aspects like the corporatization of municipal water service, urbanization, per capita income and its distribution as significant influencing factors. A significant effect of education, ethnic heterogeneity, female participation in municipal politics and water scarcity is not found. In addition, the involvement of superior government tiers of a developing country in the funding of municipal wastewater treatment infrastructure seems to mitigate the influence of social factors on wastewater treatment. Based on these findings, the thesis develops policy recommendations to improve municipal wastewater treatment in developing countries.",,"Hecker, Lutz Philip",2017,,,OPUS4-4427,Dissertation
Luminosity measurement at CMS,,"Luminosity is a key quantity of any collider, since it allows for the determination of the absolute cross sections from the observed rates in a detector. Since the Higgs boson discovery in 2012, the highest priority at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been given to an accurate understanding of the electroweak scale and a search for new physics. Precise luminosity measurements in such conditions are of crucial importance, as they determine the precision of any physics cross section measurement. To increase the production of particles of low cross section the LHC is running at the highest possible luminosity. After the first Long Shutdown (LS1) the original performance goal for the luminosity of was reached with 1011 protons per bunch and a bunch spacing of 25 ns. In such conditions radiation hard detectors with extremely fast response time are required, especially for instrumentation near the beam. The Compact Muon Solenoid experiment is equipped with three online luminometers, which fulfill the listed requirements: the Fast Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM1F), the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT) and the Forward Hadron calorimeter (HF). The BCM1F was upgraded during LS1 from 8 to 24 diamond sensors and is read out by a dedicated fast ASIC. The back-end comprises a deadtime-less histogramming unit, with 6.25 ns bin width and analog-to-digital converters with 2 ns sampling time in the VME standard. A microTCA system with better time resolution is in development. Because of its excellent time resolution BCM1F measures separately both luminosity and machine induced background particles. The performance of the detector in the first running period and radiation damage monitoring of the sensors and electronics chain form the first part of this thesis. Calibration of the luminometers at the LHC is done using van der Meer (VdM) scans. The proton beams are scanned against each other. The effective width of the beams is measured and the visible cross section, the key quantity for the luminosity measurement, is determined. The impact of detector instability, beam-beam effects, correlations of the particle density distributions in the X and Y planes, and satellite and ghost bunches are studied in detail and systematic uncertainties are derived. A comparison of the VdM scans of 2015 and 2016 completes the second part of the thesis. As a contribution to the upgrade of the beam instrumentation for the high luminosity LHC, a novel single crystal sapphire detector was designed, built and studied in a test-beam. The detector comprises a stack of sapphire plates. The response depends on the direction of the incident particles. The performance of the detector is described in the third part of the thesis. It is demonstrated that this sapphire detector can be used for the detection of single relativistic particles. The results point to the dominant contribution of the electrons to the signal generation in sapphire.",,"Karacheban, Olena",2017,,,OPUS4-4324,Dissertation
Design and analysis of integrated CMOS high-voltage drivers in low-voltage technologies,,"With scaling technology, the nominal I/O voltage of standard transistors has been reduced from 5.0 V in 0.25-um processes to 2.5 V in 65-nm. However, the supply voltages of some applications cannot be reduced at the same rate as that of shrinking technologies. Since high-voltage (HV-) compatible transistors are not available for some recent technologies and need time to be designed after developing a new process technology, designing HV-circuits based on stacked transistors has better benefits because such circuits offer technology independence and full integration with digital circuits to provide system on-chip solutions. However, the HV-circuits, especially HV-drivers, which are used for switching circuits, have a low efficiency because of the high on-resistance resulted by the stacked transistors. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to design HV-drivers with a minimum on- resistance. To achieve this goal, initially, the gate voltage of each N-stacked transistor is calculated for driving the maximum current in the pull-up and pull-down paths of the HV-driver for various supply voltages. This calculation is performed using the computer algebra system MAXIMA. Regarding the results, which are presented in mathematical formulae, a circuit design methodology is presented to design a circuit to provide the required gate voltage of the each stacked nMOS or pMOS transistor of an HV-driver. Based on this design methodology, a 2-stacked and a 3-stacked CMOS HV-driver is designed in 65-nm TSMC with I/O standard transistors with a nominal voltage of 2.5 V. The simulation results show that the provided gate voltages track approximately the ideal values. In comparison to prior work, the pull-up on-resistances of these HV-drivers are improved about 36% for the maximum allowed supply voltages of 5.0 V and 7.5 V and the pull-down on-resistances have an improvement of 40% and 46%, respectively. For switching a buck converter, the designed 3-stacked CMOS HV-driver is optimised by increasing the number of transistors in each stack. The circuit defined as 3HVDv1 with an area of about 0.187 mm2 is implemented and fabricated on chips using two different package technologies: chip-in-package and chip-on-board. The parasitic effects of bond wires and packaging are discussed in detail. In addition to this main goal, 3- and a 4-stacked CMOS HV-drivers, 3HVDv2 and 4HVDv3, are designed in view of the drawbacks identified during the design, implementation, simulations and measurements; however, the second design (4HVDv3) is an improved form of the first one (3HVDv2). This HV-driver, 4HVDv3, has improved benefits compared to the other designed circuits and also the common HV-drivers, because it can be applied for supply voltages ranging from 3.5 V to 7.5 V. This range is extended by 66%; no reference voltages are required since the regulating of the stacked main transistors is achieved by using a self-biasing cascade method.",,"Pashmineh Azar, Sara Toktam",2017,,,OPUS4-4251,Dissertation
Conceptual aspects of future High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) electrical power transmission networks,,"A continually growing demand for reliable energy supply makes existing power systems more heavily loaded and evokes engineers and experts to look for feasible immediate solutions in power energy transmission. One of these solutions might be a bulk power transmission network at extra high voltages based on direct current. Currently, high voltage direct current (HV DC) transmission has been only realized in point-to-point systems and back-to-back arrangements. Thus, the next logical step in this development would be an HV DC network. In principle, it might have certain advantages over a conventional high voltage AC system, as it could be less closely meshed covering larger areas and transmit higher electric power with lower losses. However, no well-grounded investigations concerning possible layout and operation of an HV DC network are publicly available. Experience from the HV DC lines does not allow to make substantial conclusions regarding the requirements for an HV DC network. Therefore, some basic questions on the operation of an HV DC network need to be answered mainly from systems simulations.",,"Samborsky, Michael",2017,,,OPUS4-4365,Dissertation
Optimization of network intrusion detection processes,,"Intrusion detection is a concept from the field of IT security. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are used in addition to preventative measures, such as firewalls, to enable an automated detection of attacks. Network security threats often consist of multiple attack phases directed against various components of the network. During each attack phase, varying types of security-related events can be observed at various points in the network. Security monitoring, however, is nowadays essentially limited to the uplink to the internet. Sometimes it is also used to a limited extent at key points within a network, but the analysis methods do not have the same depth as at the uplink. Other areas, such as virtual networks in virtual machines (VMs), are not covered at all, yet. The aim of this thesis has been to improve the detection capability of attacks in local area networks. With a glance at the area of safety engineering, it appears efficient to secure these networks thoroughly and to develop additional monitoring solutions only for the remaining problem cases. This entails several challenges for the analysis of different parts of the TCP/IP stack. The lowermost part of the network stack has to be analyzed for attacks on network components, such as switches and VM bridges. For this, there is still no technology. Although attacks on the layers~2 and 3, such as ARP spoofing and rogue DHCP servers in physical networks, can be controlled to some extent by appropriate switches, equivalent methods are not used in virtual networks. Therefore, a software-defined networking based approach is proposed to counteract the respective attacks, which works for physical and virtual networks. The upper layers are already largely covered by traditional NIDS methods, but the rapidly increasing data rates of local area networks often lead to an uncontrolled discarding of traffic due to overload situations in the monitoring stations. Therefore, the drawbacks of current optimization approaches are outlined based on a detailed performance profiling of typical intrusion detection systems. A new approach for parallelizing the intrusion detection analysis that copes with the increasing network dynamics is introduced and evaluated. Since further special issues for NIDS particularly go back to the massive use of web technologies in today's networks, a firewall architecture is presented which applies novel NIDS methods based on machine learning to identify web applications and to ward off malicious inputs. The architecture addresses the entire process chain starting from the data transfer with HTTP via the analysis of manipulated web documents to the extraction and analysis of active contents.",,"Rietz, René",2017,,,OPUS4-4432,Dissertation
Enhancing renewable energy deployment in Malawi through climate finance instruments: policy challenges and prospects,,"Malawi is a Least Developed Country located in Southern Africa to the East of Zambia. Malawi has a low electrification rate of 9%. Furthermore, unreliable and inadequate power supply are estimated to reduce Malawi's GDP by 7%-9%. These energy sector challenges diminish the country's prospects for sustained growth, poverty reduction, and improved delivery of health and education services. Various studies have been undertaken to determine how Malawi can improve it's energy sector through the deployment of renewable energy. However, these studies have not specifically examined how climate change related financing mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be utilised to mobilise financing and capacity development for renewable energy deployment in the country. This is despite the assertion that developed countries are committed to jointly mobilising US$100 billion per year by 2020 to support climate change mitigation and adaptation activities such as renewable energy deployment in developing countries. Through the use of questionnaires, case study analyses, policy reviews, academic literature reviews and interviews, this research sought to determine Malawi's regulatory and institutional challenges and prospects for enhancing renewable energy deployment through climate finance instruments. Among some of the research findings was that Malawi has relied on external support in order to develop capacity in the field of climate finance, hence in the absence of external assistance there are limited opportunities to incentivise various stakeholders to implement projects and to enhance awareness about climate finance. The study also discovered that Malawi's climate finance determinants resemble a non-market seeking Foreign Direct Investment profile, hence the presence of opportunities for cheap and abundant emission reductions could improve climate finance investment patterns rather than the opportunities for emission reductions and co-products such as electricity through renewable energy technologies. The study therefore recommended that Malawi should create a renewable energy and climate finance promotion agency to assist with soliciting funding for renewable energy projects from concessional and non-concessional sources and drafting and implementing renewable energy policies. Another recommendation was that the country must create a Renewable Energy Fund to reduce the funding constraints that the media, project implementers and financiers have in undertaking various roles related to enhancing renewable energy deployment. Lastly, the study concluded that Malawi's prospects for accessing various forms of climate finance and deploying climate finance projects can be improved through improvements in Malawi's renewable energy and climate change institutional framework, and the modifications of climate finance instruments and methodologies to encourage flexibility and reduce institutional constraints.",,"Chirambo, Dumisani",2017,,,OPUS4-4395,Dissertation
Catastrophe and challenge - Cultural heritage in post-conflict recovery,,"Fourth International Conference on Heritage Conservation and Site Management December 5-7, 2016, BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg The destructive effects of war, and particularly the deliberate targeting of cultural sites, constitute an exceptional challenge for Heritage Conservation. The general principles of retaining cultural significance by continuous care and by minimal intervention may seem of little use when one is faced with catastrophic and wide-spread damage to culturally significant places - be they individual monuments, urban structures or archaeological sites. Post-conflict recovery encompasses a wide range of topics, many of which have not yet been studied in depth. This puplication presents papers presented during the conference on »Cultural Heritage in Post-Conflict Recovery«. The conference, held in December 2016 was the fourth out of the series »Heritage Conservation and Site Management«, initiated both by BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg and Helwan University Cairo. The conference series is linked to their Joint Master Programme »Heritage Conservation and Site Management«. Adressing the subject of Post-Conflict Recovery, BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg and Helwan University Cairo are taking a first step towards sketching the scope and the depth of the problems of Heritage and War. Speakers from many countries are providing insights into approaches to cope with these problems.",,,2017,,,OPUS4-4373,Konferenzveröffentlichung
Verification of software for Contiki-based low-power embedded systems using software model checking,,"The main building blocks for the internet of things are connected embedded systems. Often these systems are also used in safety critical applications. Therefore, it is particularly important that these devices work according to their specification i.e. they behave as intended. Nowadays, even for simple devices embedded operating systems as Contiki are used to simplify application development and to increase portability between different hardware platforms. The main objective of this thesis is to present a methodology for the verification of software applications written for the operation system Contiki, taking the system hardware into account. Therefore, software model checking and especially bounded model checking [BCC&#8314;03] is used as a technique, which allows to formally verify software for embedded systems. For verifying the software against its specification, it is also necessary to build a model of the system hardware. Thereby, the difficulty is to create a model which is detailed enough to capture the hardware behavior so that the software performs correctly, while keeping the computation effort for the verification process manageable. In this work, the drivers which communicate with the hardware are therefore replaced with abstract models during the verification process. This enables the verification based on an abstract hardware platform independent of specific hardware. A special role within embedded systems play interrupts. Interrupts are used to save power and can also be used to react on external events. Current methods for verification of interrupt driven software are based on the interleaving model and partial order reduction to reduce the size of the verification problem. This thesis argues that this method is not sufficient for software, whose behavior relies on periodically occurring interrupts. Therefore, in this thesis, a new approach called periodic interrupt modeling is introduced. This approach can be applied automatically and reduces the number of incorrect verification results due to inaccurate modeling. In addition, properties can be proven that depend on the number of occurring interrupts. Using applications for the Contiki operating system, and based on a verification flow, the approaches toward interrupt modeling are compared.",,"Vörtler, Thilo",2017,,,OPUS4-4408,Dissertation
Metastable zone determination and nucleation kinetics during melt crystallization of poly-unsaturated fatty acids,,"The range of application of fatty acids is as broad and varied as the diverse kinds of fatty acids themselves, stretching from bulk scale productions as in the case of biodiesel or lubricant manufacturing over consumer or end products like cosmetics, medicinal or nutritional additives to relatively smaller scale specialty chemicals like epoxy resins, insect repellents and so on. The crystallization temperatures of the unsaturated fatty acids are much lower than those of the saturated ones, which is an important and desirable property for raw materials such as in the production of epoxy resins. Separation and purification of these enriched unsaturated fatty acid fractions depending on their applications is mainly performed by two thermal fractionation processes, namely, distillation and crystallization. The potential behind the success of purification of these multi-component organic fatty acid mixtures with the help of melt crystallization, apart from the fact that it is cost effective owing to the obvious reduction of solvent removal and regeneration steps, is that of the relatively large differences in the melting points of the individual fatty acids. A detailed and fundamental understanding of the crystallization especially nucleation kinetics of a variety of vegetable oil based fatty acid mixtures has been provided in this work. It also describes the solid-liquid phase diagrams of these poly-unsaturated mixtures including their metastable zone widths of nucleation and solidification. This theoretical part of this thesis is a detailed resource on the global production and application of vegetable oils and their derivatives. A clear mathematical and physical road map for the application of the Fisher Turnbull model to calculate the enthalpy values starting from the very basic supersaturation equation has been established and extensively explained as well. Nucleation studies have been carried out on various reactor setups in micro-, milli- and liter-scale. It successfully models the induction times of nucleation as a function of supercooling at different cooling rates both in micro and macro scale. 3D modeling of this parameter to see the combined effects of temperature and in turn viscosity have also been successfully implemented on the milliliter scale results, as more of the bulk nucleation phenomenon was observed in the latter. Fisher Turnbull plot and the Gibbs Thompsons model were adjusted and applied to correlate the Gibbs free energy, involved with the rate of nucleation captured by the FBRM&#8482; (Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement) technology. The scope of this measurement technology was also tested in liter scale. The results showed that FBRM technology is applicable when the solution is relatively dilute and does not have too many overlapping crystals.",,"Dasgupta, Sunanda",2017,,,OPUS4-4417,Dissertation
Role of substrates morphology and chemistry in ALD HfO&#8322; on Si(111)-H terminated surfaces as model,,"This work presents an approach to investigate fundamental aspects concerning the early stage of the atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth process on stepped surfaces. The first interaction between precursors and surface is strongly important for the ALD growth that it is still far away from the status to be completely understood. For this purpose, a few ALD-cycles withtetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium (TDMAH) and trimethylaluminum (TMA) as metallic precursors and water (H&#8322;O) as oxidant has been performed in order to study the initial metal oxide film growth on stepped surfaces such as silicon Si(111)-H terminated, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and silver deposited HOPG (Ag-HOPG). These investigations have been carried out at various substrate temperatures, where scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been used systematically to probe the ALD features. This technique is delivering unique knowledge about the locality and the density of nucleation's sites on the different substrates. The data collected are then subjected to a mathematical model to understand the growth and to determine the effect of the surface morphology and chemistry on the behavior of the nucleation. The in-situ cycle-by-cycle STM investigation of 4 initial ALD cycles of TDMAH and H&#8322;O on Si(111)-H terminated at room temperature (RT) and at 280°C displays two regimes of growth: In Regime I (1st - 2nd cycle) an increase in roughness in the first cycle to 0.2nm and 0.34nm respectively for RT and 280°C with a partial surface coverage of 71% and 54% is observed. In the 2nd cycle, the coverage increased to ~98% and 94% maintaining the same film height of the 1st cycle. A complete layer is formed in this regime. The results are discussed in reference to the Puurunen model. Following this model, the determination of the reaction mechanism in relation to the number of Hf atoms/nm² attached to the surface reveals that two ligands exchanges occur at RT and one ligand exchange at 280°C in the first regime. In addition, the origin of the reaction saturation was determined to be caused by the steric hindrance effect. In this first regime, the growth model is governed by random deposition followed by Mullins diffusion as determined from the universal values found for the roughness dynamic exponents (&#945;, &#946;, 1/z) of the film.",,"Rouissi, Zied",2017,,,OPUS4-4241,Dissertation
Development of a novel diamond based detector for machine induced background and luminosity measurements,,"The LHC is the largest particle accelerator and storage ring in the world, used to investigate fundamentals of particle physics and to develop at the same time the technology of accelerators and detectors. Four main experiments (ATLAS, ALICE, CMS and LHCb) , located around the LHC ring, provide insight into the nature of particles and search for answers to as yet unexplained phenomena in the universe. Two proton or heavy ion beams circulate in the LHC and are brought into collision in the four experiments. The physics potential of each experiment is determined by the luminosity, which is a ratio of the number of the events during a certain time period to the cross section of a physics process. A measurement of the luminosity is therefore essential to determine the cross section of interesting physics processes. In addition, safe and high-quality data-taking requires stable beam conditions with almost no beam losses. Each experiment has its own detectors to measure beam losses, hereafter called machine induced background. One such detector is installed in CMS, BCM1F. Based on diamond sensors it was designed and built to measure both, the luminosity and the machine induced background. BCM1F ran smoothly during the first LHC running period from 2009-2012 and delivered valuable beam loss and luminosity information to the control rooms of CMS and LHC. At the end of 2012 the LHC was shut down to improve the performance by increasing the proton energy to 7TeV and decreasing the proton bunch spacing to 25ns. Due to the success of BCM1F an upgrade of its sensors and readout components was planned in order to fulfil the new requirements. The upgrade of the sensors comprises a two pad instead of one pad metallization. 24 instead of the previous 8 single crystal diamond sensors were foreseen for the new BCM1F to enhance the robustness and redundancy. To instrument BCM1F, 59 sensors were electrically characterized by measuring the leakage current, signal stability and charge collection efficiency. Quality criteria were defined to select sensors for the final installation. An overview of these measurements including a summary of the results is given in this thesis. In addition, an upgraded amplifier was developed within the collaboration in 130nm CMOS technology. It has a peaking time of 7ns instead of the 22ns of the one previously installed. A BCM1F prototype comprising a two pad sensor and the upgraded amplifier was tested at the DESY-II accelerator in a 5GeV electron beam. Results of these test-beam measurements are presented in this thesis as well as simulations to interpret the measurements. The installation of the upgraded BCM1F was completed in 2014. In 2015 BCM1F was commissioned and started to measure luminosity and machine induced background. At the end, the thesis will describe both types of measurements with the focus on machine induced background demonstrating the functionality of BCM1F.",,"Hempel, Maria",2017,,,OPUS4-4286,Dissertation
Diversität und Identifizierung von Mykorrhizapilzen des Heidekrautgewächses (Ericaceae) Comarostaphylis arbutoides aus Costa Rica,,"In this study the mycorrhizal community of the Ericaceae Comarostaphylis arbutoides was investigated to reveal further ectomycorrhizal fungal species that are associated with this tropical plant. Mycorrhizal systems of selected genera were investigated in more detail regarding their phylogeny, morphology, and anatomy as well as the genetic confirmation of the associated host tree. The genetic investigation of mycorrhizal systems collected at the Cerro de la Muerte (Costa Rica) detected a diverse fungal community. Most common were species of the genera Russula, Cortinarius, and Cenococcum, as well as not further determined members of the Cantharellaceae and Helotiales. The genera Cenococcum, Clavaria/Clavulina, Phellodon, Piloderma, Sebacina, Tomentella/Thelephora, as well as Xerocomus could be proven genetically for the first time from Costa Rica based on mycorrhizal systems. Comarostaphylis arbutoides was proven to be mycorrhizal with Leotia cf. lubrica, Sebacina sp., and diverse species of the genus Cortinarius. Species of other genera are also assumed, but their confirmation is still to be made. On the basis of genetics and the investigation of its mycorrhizal systems, the collected Costa Rican Sebacina sp. may constitute a hitherto not described species. However, to confirm this assumption fruit body investigations are necessary. Sebacina sp. was proven in this study to be also mycorrhizal with Quercus sp. The ascomycete Leotia lubrica was proven to be mycorrhizal for the first time. However, mycorrhizal findings of this species are still rare in literature and further studies are necessary to underpin its new status. As Leotia lubrica occurs worldwide, other host plants, beside the proven Comarostaphylis arbutoides, are assumed for this species as well. The mycorrhizal samples of the genus Cortinarius could comprise approximately 15 species. Their final determination is still outstanding, but it is assumed that also hitherto not known species were detected in this study. A host preference is indicated as species of Cortinarius are found to be associated either with Comarostaphylis arbutoides or Quercus sp., but needs to be confirmed by including mycorrhizal samples of Quercus trees. One third of the sequenced mycorrhizal systems still remain unidentified. Therefore, repeated comparison with sequence databases is recommended. The phylogenetic and morphological/anatomical investigation of already identified as well as unidentified mycorrhizal systems is advised to deliver additional descriptions of Costa Rican ectomycorrhizal fungi and therefore contribute to the knowledge of tropical fungal species.",,"Kühdorf, Katja",2017,,,OPUS4-4145,Dissertation
Identification of the state of stress in iron and steel truss structures by vibration-based experimental investigations,,"Safety evaluation of truss structures depends upon the determination of the axial forces and corresponding stresses in axially loaded members. Due to presence of damages, change in intended use, increase in service loads or accidental actions, structural assessment of existing truss structures is necessary. Precise identification of the stresses plays a crucial role for the preservation of historic truss structures. The assessment measures require non-destructiveness, minimum intervention and practical applicability. Motivated by the preservation of existing truss&#8722;type constructions composed of axially loaded slender members, the present work aims to develop a non-destructive methodology to identify the axial forces or corresponding stress states in iron and steel truss structures. The approach is based on vibration measurements and the finite element method combined with optimization techniques. After a state of the art review, numerical and experimental studies were carried out in the research work on different partial systems of truss-type structures. The examined aspects included the effects of structural loading on the dynamic performance of truss structures, modelling of joint connections, mode pairing criteria, selection of updating parameters and definition of an objective function, as well as the use of different optimization techniques. A methodology consisted of a two-stage model updating procedure using optimization techniques was proposed for the determination of multiple member axial forces and estimation of the joint flexibility of truss-type constructions. In the first stage optimization, the validation criterion is based on the experimentally identified global natural frequencies and mode shapes of the truss. Additionally, the axial forces in selected individual members of the truss are used. They are estimated from the natural frequencies and five amplitudes of the corresponding local mode shapes of the members using an analytically&#8722;based algorithm. Based on the results of the identified axial forces in the first stage, a second optimization procedure for the joint stiffness is performed. In this stage, the modal parameters of the global natural frequencies and mode shapes are used as validation criterion. From the results of the investigated systems, the identified axial forces by the proposed methodology agree well with the experimentally measured axial forces. Furthermore, recommendations are given in the work for a guideline of measuring concepts and assessment strategies applied to existing iron and steel truss-type structures.",,"Luong, Thi Mai Hoa",2017,,,OPUS4-4414,Dissertation
The moral economy of solidarity: A longitudinal study of special needs teachers,,"Based on a longitudinal study of a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) in England for children excluded from mainstream schools and utilising a moral economy lens, this article explores how solidarity is created and maintained in a very particular community of teachers and learning support assistants (LSAs). A moral economy approach highlights the centrality of people's moral norms and values for understanding the multi-layered dimensions of solidarity in organisations and how it changes in the context of transformations in the labour process. The article illustrates how teachers and LSAs rely on mutuality, underpinned by moral norms of justice, and values of care, dignity and recognition, to cope with physically and emotionally demanding work that is under-resourced and undervalued. The analysis reveals that solidarity is not only against unjust workplace regimes, but also for connectivity and a humanised labour process.","Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management,Economics and Econometrics,Sociology and Political Science,Accounting","Bolton, Sharon C.; Laaser, Knut",2017,10.1177/0950017019871237,"10.1111/j.1468-2338.2008.00510.x, 10.1057/9780230281622, 10.1111/j.1468-2338.2011.00616.x, 10.1080/07078552.2016.1208793, 10.1111/j.1467-8543.2012.00906.x, 10.1177/0950017013479828, 10.1177/0950017012438579, 10.1017/CBO9780511584886, 10.4324/9781315678573, 10.1146/annurev.so.21.080195.001413, 10.1177/0143831X18777618, 10.4324/9780203213940, 10.1177/0143831X18777612, 10.1177/0950017015617686, 10.1177/0950017013490332, 10.1017/CBO9780511488863, 10.1007/978-1-137-02023-9_2, 10.1017/CBO9780511734779, 10.1080/0161956X.2017.1349492, 10.4324/9781315678573-13, ",OPUS4-5212,Wissenschaftlicher Artikel
"Facilitating the process towards social sustainability : a culture-based method for mapping the publicness of historic public places; applied using the example of Tabriz Bazaar, Iran",,"As the current literature on public space shows, the significant role of public space in enhancing social sustainability is justified - at least theoretically (Yadollahi, 2015).

Phytoplankton nitrogen and phosphorus limitation and the N2-fixation potential of Nostocales at varying nitrogen supplies and light intensities in lakes,,"In order to lower the phytoplankton biomass in lakes it is theoretically most effective to reduce the nutrient that is actually limiting. However, it is widely assumed that the abundance and N&#8322;-fixation rate of N&#8322;-fixing cyanobacteria (Nostocales) would increase in response to reduced N loading, and thereby render efforts to improve water quality by N reduction ineffective. Nostocales N&#8322;-fixation has a huge energy demand and consequently the light intensity may affect the response of Nostocales biovolume and N&#8322;-fixation to varying N additions. This led to the following aims, for which three different sets of experiments were conducted. (i) Determination of the seasonal dynamic of N- and P-limitation for four lakes of differing lake types in the German lowlands and testing the power of four N:P ratios to predict the limiting nutrient: Biweekly experiments were performed in 4 lakes differing in lake. For the shallow lakes there was a trend from P limitation in spring to N or light limitation in summer and autumn, while the deep lake remained predominantly P limited. The ability of in-lake N:P ratios to predict the relative strength of N vs. P limitation was tested using linear regression. All four N:P ratios had significant positive relationships with the response ratio to N and P additions, but the TN:TP and DIN:TP ratios performed best. Nitrogen limitation was predictable, frequent and persistent, suggesting that nitrogen reduction could play a role in water quality management. (ii) Determination of the response of Nostocales biovolume and N&#8322;-fixation to varying N additions: To achieve this, an experiment with water from an N limited lake (LAN) was conducted. While the Nostocales biovolume did not respond to varying N additions, the N&#8322;-fixation increased in low N microcosms. To quantify the extent to which Nostocales compensated for the varying N addition rate, we calculated a compensation rate (CR). By the end of the experiment a CR of 36 % was reached. However, at biovolumes typical for summer in LAN the CR would be much lower. Therefore, in shallow polymictic lakes like LAN, reduced N loading may lower both in-lake N concentrations and biovolumes of non-fixing phytoplankton without significantly impacting Nostocales biovolume. (iii) Determination of the effect of the light intensity on the response of Nostocales biovolume and N&#8322;-fixation to varying N additions: To accomplish this aim another microcosm experiment with water from LAN was conducted. While at low and intermediate light intensities the reduction of N addition had no effect on Nostocales biovolume, at high light intensities it led to an increase. The N&#8322;-fixation increased at all light intensities when N addition got reduced. This positive response to a reduction in N addition increased with light, showing that Nostocales may take advantage of being able to fix N&#8322; mainly at high light intensities.",,"Kolzau, Sebastian",2017,,,OPUS4-4288,Dissertation

"The capacity of institutional innovation following the diffusion of urban plans. Explorations of impacts of an urban master plan in Kigali, Rwanda.",,"In the breeding ground of urban growth, master plans are reinvigorating around the world and gain special consideration in African countries. Most of the time urban master plans are developed by mandated (international) firms, which transfer urban design scheme ideas or strategic instruments out of their planning practice. Although this process is common in everyday planning practice, there is a lack of knowledge about the consequences of such planning processes. The case of Kigali - the capital of Rwanda &#8212; reflects these urban planning phenomena. The political will and planning efforts in Kigali for urbanisation are big. City officials are constantly renewing planning policies as well as institutions and have commissioned Surbana International Consultants Pte Ltd from Singapore to develop the city's Detailed Master Plan (2011-2013). My research, therefore, discusses institutional innovation (the amount and the extent) in Kigali, resulting from its Detailed Master Plan. The motivation behind my research is to examine the planning diffusion process through urban consultancy, with the goal of bringing analytical and interpretative aspects of the ordinary process of urban consultancy into academic discourse. Combining the concepts of innovation and planning diffusion allows for an understanding of the local consequences of global urban consultancy. My research analyses the consequences of planning diffusion looking at institutional innovation processes in urban planning of Kigali which can be linked to the implementation of the Detailed Master Plan. The analysis is conducted in two strands. The first is an analysis of innovation resulting from identifying potential and relevant institutional innovations. My work develops an analytical scheme of potential and relevant institutional innovation in order to apply it in the case of urban planning in Kigali. The second strand is an analysis of planning diffusion, which should reveal the origins of potential institutional innovation and illustrate the conceptual term. My research also discusses negative effects of potential innovation and gives recommendations to create relevant institutional innovation.",,"Pätsch, Carolin",2017,,,OPUS4-4353,Dissertation

Developing a conceptual solution for domestic wastewater management in developing countries: Kumasi (Ghana) as a case study,,"Wastewater treatment systems abound as a result of technological improvements in treatment processes. Therefore in the selection of a wastewater treatment system for a particular wastewater treatment situation there are many alternatives to choose from. Despite this development municipal wastewater treatment in communities in developing countries are not always sustainable due to the application of inappropriate treatment systems. The question is how can an appropriate treatment system be identified for a certain location? The answer to this question is of importance to developing countries where wastewater treatment is usually not sustainable. In this study a framework for assessing wastewater treatment systems was developed. First, a comprehensive set of indicators representing parameters of treatment systems and properties of the study area that impacts on wastewater treatment were identified. Secondly, assessment of these indicators were carried out through expert and community survey to identify a final set of indicators whose composition consist of efficiency, reliability and simplicity of treatment systems and resource constraint, resource recovery and environmental concerns of the study area. Thirdly, four wastewater treatment systems, namely: Waste Stabilization Ponds, Trickling Filter, reed bed and free water surface Constructed Wetlands considered to be feasible for the study area were evaluated by the application of the identified indicators. Finally, a decision matrix produced was processed by multi-attribute decision making methods using two indicator weights to identify the most appropriate treatment system among the four alternatives. Results of the study show that in a scenario where equal indicator weights are assumed, reed bed is identified as the most appropriate with stabilization ponds being ranked as the least appropriate. In a more practical scenario where the weights of the indicators are allocated to reflect conditions of the study area, free water surface is ranked as the most appropriate. This outcome is at variance with stabilization pond technologies currently installed at communities in the study area. The performance of constructed wetlands is at the midpoint as far as most of the high to medium weighted assessment indicators are concern. It therefore represents a compromising solution between waste stabilization pond and trickling filter. The study also shows a change in variants of constructed wetland with a change in indicator weights. An indication that the decision situation determines the appropriateness of a treatment system and not the treatment system itself. The selection framework employed in this study can be said to be reliable and capable of identifying a treatment system that can be appropriate for a particular location. This is because the choice of a constructed wetland for the study area fits the definition of appropriate treatment system defined by the final indicators identified in this study.",,"Apau, Kwaku Boakye",2017,,,OPUS4-4154,Dissertation
Optimization of converting food waste to hydrogen and Biogas in double-stage-fermentation,,"Aim of this study The aim of this research is to develop batch scale and continuous reactor systems to evaluate technical and practical feasibility of sequential hydrogen and methane from food waste by two step dark fermentation process. Methodology The effects of limiting factors, like pH, temperature, as well as inoculum sources and pretreatment methods on H&#8322; yields were studies in batch assays. In addition, the feasibility of sequencing producing H&#8322;+CH&#8324; via two stage dark fermentation process was evaluated in lab-scale tests based on batch assay results. Three kinds of Acid producing reactor, like CSTR, semi-percolator, and ASBR had been tested for bioH&#8322; production and well inoculated ASBR methane was used for further degradation of volatile organic acids produced in these acid producing reactor which acts as by-products of bioH&#8322;. Different limiting factors on fermentation process have been investigated in each reactor type for optimum energy recovery. Monodigestion of food waste for methane production was also studied and used as reference value for energy recovery from food waste. Main results and technical application from this study Hydrogen production results from food waste were shown to be possible with aerated inoculum in batch assays in thermophilic range, with highest H&#8322; yields of 19.72L/(kg oTS) from food waste. The inoculated HPB (Hydrogen producing bacterial) sludge taken from ASBR acid producing reactor was proved the optimum H&#8322; yields with the value of 61.41 L/(kg oTS) in this batch test. Inoculum to substrates ratio at 3 was found the best situ for H&#8322; yields in batch test. Even H&#8322; productivity at hyperthermophilic range has been confirmed with faster and higher performance, thermophilic fermentation process was taken in continuously lab-scale investigation due to too high process requirements in hyperthermophilic process. Two-stage sequencing producing H&#8322;+CH&#8324; was shown the potential in H&#8322; yields in the first acid producing phase. Methane yields from monodigestion in ASBR methane reactor with OLR of 3.88 kg oTS/(m3.d) and average CH&#8324; yields at 312.71L/kg oTS were achieved and act as reference value for total energy recovery. In CSTR+ASBRMe system, the max. hydrogen yields of 69.15 L/(kg oTS) and CH&#8324; yields at 291.77. L/(kg oTS) were achieved; In semi-Percolator+ASBRMe system, the max. hydrogen yields of 77.34 L/kg oTS and average CH&#8324; yields at 293.87 L/(kg oTS) were achieved; In ASBR+ASBRMe system, the max. hydrogen yields of 196.85L/(kg oTS) and average CH&#8324; yields at 293.87 L/(kg oTS) were achieved. The max. H&#8322; concentration in hydrolysis gas was got in ASBR acid producing reactor at 54%. The experimental results indicated that food wastes can be considered as suitable substrates for BioH&#8322; and CH&#8324; sequencing production.

Using the sustainable forest landscape governance approach as the overarching conceptual for an effective REDD+ implementation within the Brazilian context and, building on this analysis, the conclusions advance some considerations on what features should be prioritized in the development and establishment of the Brazilian REDD+ national strategy. This dissertation is a grounded theoretical analysis and is centered on the conception that although REDD+ is strongly treated by the Federal Government as an expansion of it's actions with regard to sustainable development, by turning forests into an economic asset and strengthening institutions and laws, it is much more likely that Brazil can deal with the environmental challenges it has been facing.",,"Gallo Barbosa Lima, Patricia",2017,,,OPUS4-4398,Dissertation
(Coloured) Hybrid Petri nets in Snoopy - user manual,,"Hybrid simulation of biological processes becomes widely used to overcome the limitations of the pure stochastic or the complete deterministic simulation. In this manual, we present easy-to-follow steps for constructing and executing hybrid models via Snoopy [HHL+12]. Snoopy is a tool to design and animate or simulate hierarchical graphs, i.e., qualitative, stochastic, continuous, and hybrid Petri nets. This manual is concerned with hybrid Petri nets (HPN) [HH12] as well as their coloured counterpart (HPNC) [HLR14]. HPN combine the merits of stochastic and continuous Petri nets into one single class. Moreover, HPN in Snoopy supports state of the art hybrid simulation algorithms (e.g., [HH16]) to execute the constructed HPN models. Simulating a model using Snoopy's hybrid simulation involves first constructing the reaction network via HPN notations and afterwards executing such model.",,"Herajy, Mostafa; Liu, Fei; Rohr, Christian; Heiner, Monika",2017,,,OPUS4-4157,Bericht
Non-destructive Assessment of the Axial Stress State in Iron and Steel Truss Structures by Dynamic Measurements,,"This paper is concerned with the inverse identification of the stress state in axially loaded slender members of iron and steel truss structures using measured dynamic data. A methodology is proposed based on the finite element model updating coupled with nature-inspired optimization techniques, in particular the particle swarm optimization. The numerical model of truss structures is calibrated using natural frequencies and mode shapes from vibration tests, as well as additional information of the axial forces in selected truss members based on the experimentally identified modal parameters. The results of the identification are the axial forces or corresponding stresses in truss structures and the joint rigidity in relation to pinned and rigid conditions. Attention is given to several examined aspects, including the effects of the axial tensile and compressive forces on the dynamic responses of trusses, mode pairing criteria, as well as modeling assumptions of joints and the use of a joint rigidity parameter. Considering the pairing of modes, it is performed by adapting an enhanced modal assurance criterion that allows the selection of desired clusters of degrees-of-freedom. Thus, information extracted from the measurements related to specific modes is utilized in a more beneficial way. For modeling of joints, the numerical model of a truss structure includes rotational springs of variable stiffness to represent semi-rigid connections. Moreover, a fixity factor is introduced for practical estimation of the joint flexibility. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by case studies involving simulated and laboratory experimental data.",Applied Mathematics,"Luong, Thi Mai Hoa; Zabel, Volkmar; Lorenz, Werner; Rohrmann, Rolf G.",2017,10.1016/j.proeng.2017.09.447,"10.1016/S0022-460X(02)00902-1, 10.1016/j.jsv.2011.02.024, 10.1016/j.jsv.2012.10.019, 10.1016/j.jsv.2013.03.018, 10.1016/j.jsv.2013.05.017, 10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.499, 10.1016/j.jcsr.2009.03.002, 10.1016/j.jsv.2010.07.006, ",OPUS4-4291,Wissenschaftlicher Artikel
Development and reduction of a multicomponent reference fuel for gasoline,,"Within this thesis, a detailed multicomponent gasoline surrogate reaction scheme was developed and reduced to a four component scheme of skeletal size. The main target is to cover the most important features for typical spark ignited (SI) combustion - flame propagation, emission formation and the tendency to auto ignite and subsequently cause engine knock. To achieve this a variable mechanism concept was developed to include sub models for different fuels as needed. Using this approach a detailed mechanism describing the oxidation of n-heptane, iso-octane, toluene and ethanol was compiled and compared against various experiments published in literature. Furthermore, correlations were developed to suggest four component gasoline surrogates based on typical fuel data sheets. The correlation method is validated against measurements in Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine from various groups and further compared against correlations between octane numbers (ON) and predicted 0D ignition delay times. These correlations are used to identify and discuss the impact of the uncertainty of two reactions on ignition delay time of a multicomponent fuel. To be able to reduce the detailed scheme in a time efficient way existing reduction concepts where improved and applied to different schemes and targets. Since various reduction techniques are available, an optimal sequence of those was worked out. Using this sequence of reduction steps two multicomponent schemes were compiled: one scheme for the prediction of laminar flame speeds and one for the prediction of major emissions and auto-ignition. To underline that the suggested reduction procedure is universal it was also applied to n-heptane as single fuel surrogate for diesel fuel and to a large two component fuel from another work group.",,"Seidel, Lars",2017,,,OPUS4-4269,Dissertation
Surface and interface study of kesterite-based and related thin-film solar cell structures,,"The chemical and electronic structure of the interfaces of kesterite-based and related absorber materials in thin-film solar cell device-relevant layer stacks have been investigated with x-ray based spectroscopic techniques (XPS, HAXPES, XAES, XES, and XAS). The analyzed materials are CZTS absorbers with their interfaces to the Mo back contact and to different Zn(O,S)-buffer layers, SnS absorbers with partly N-doped ZnO buffer layers, and 2 absorbers with (Cd,Zn)S buffer layers. We find an unchanged CZTS surface in this series which has a profound effect on the ZnOS growth. Instead of a constant composition throughout the buffer thickness, we find S-rich material growing directly on the CZTS in the ALD process. The conduction band offset is found to be around -0.21(+-0.15) eV. The measured cliff is reduced by chemical interface modification towards a flat band alignment. The interface effect during annealing at the CZTS back contact where MoS2 forms occurs even at low annealing temperatures below 500°C. Sn spectra of liftoff CZTS back sides, annealed on the Mo contact, resemble the precursor at all temperatures while Sn spectra of CZTS front sides are almost single phase after standard annealing. A TiN interlayer was effectively introduced to prevent reactions at the CZTS/Mo interface. We find a strong impact of ALD deposited ZnO on oxidized SnS absorber surfaces, resulting in metallic Sn formation. In contrast, doped ZnO:N reduces the SnS much less agressively. The strong downwards bending for both ZnO and SnS at the ZnO/SnS junction that we find for undoped ZnO contact layers is drastically reduced if ZnO:N contact layers are used. The smaller cliff in the conduction band of 0.2 eV for ZnO:N/SnS makes this junction much more interesting for solar cell applications than the ZnO/SnS with a large cliff of 0.55 eV. The chemical analysis of the (Cd,Zn)S:Ga/CuSbS2 reveals chemical interaction at the junction. We find an additional species on the high energy side of the Cu peak for all samples. The interface species can be explained with the changed buffer composition at the interface, particularly low S and Cd content and increased Ga concentration, and could also be affected by the presence of O and hydroxides. We find an upwards surface band bending of -0.15 eV for the bare absorber. At the junction, we see downwards band bending of up to 0.2(+-0.09) eV in the absorber and strong upwards band bending of -0.75(+-0.28) eV in the buffer. The junction is not an abrupt transition from one homogenious material to another. The buffer growth is strongly affected by the absorber. Also the electronic structure on both sides is significantly affected. We find a conduction band alignment with a large cliff of -1.3(+-0.3) eV.",,"Köhler, Leonard",2017,,,OPUS4-4354,Dissertation

Influence of various welding sequence schemes on the load bearing capacity of square hollow section T-joint,,"From modelling point of view, it will be very useful if the parameters of interest which contribute to the residual stresses and distortions in various types of welded joint and structure application can be simulated numerically so that welding performance with respect to the various aspects could be assessed and evaluated in an efficient manner. The present study focuses on numerical simulation of welding sequence effects on temperature distribution, residual stresses and distortions and load bearing capacity of a T-joint made by square hollow sections. The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of various welding sequence patterns and welding imperfections on the load bearing capacity of a S355 steel square hollow section (SHS) T-Joint. Two different FE-based programs are used to simulate the welding process: the ABAQUS Welding Interface (AWI) and SYSWELD v2014. The type of welding process used is metal active gas (MAG) welding. A fillet weld with a throat thickness of 5mm is performed. Temperature distribution has been measured at different distance with respect to the weld bead for better validation of results from the simulation. Due to the geometrical characteristics of this type of joint, a compressive test is performed. A displacement with a magnitude of -110 mm is applied on the upper surface of the vertical member (brace). The displacement of several points while the loading process has been measured by inductive displacement transducers. Total number of six specimens were tested. Three joints were welded the same for checking the test set-up (statically checks). The ratio of the width of the branch member to the chord member &#946;=0.5 was kept the same for all specimens. So, the influence of welding schemes could be investigated clearer. The failure and the joint behaviour under loading condition are analysed. For better evaluation of results apart from the main cases, two extra numerical simulations are performed which help making a sufficient conclusion. The results for stresses in the x, y and z directions, after and before loading, are plotted and discussed. Furthermore it has been clearly explained if lower magnitude of residual stresses could lead to a positive gain in strength or not. The differences and influencing parameters on the load bearing capacity are identified. Additionally, some recommendations for AWI users are given. Stress concentration and how the number of start and end points could influence the overall behaviour of the joints are recognized.",,"Moradi Eshkafti, Milad",2017,,,OPUS4-4421,Dissertation
Kinetic mechanism of surrogates for biodiesel,,"In recent years, biodiesel is an alternative fuel to petroleum diesel that is renewable and creates less harmful emissions than conventional diesel. Biodiesel blends - usually B20 or below, have been the most commonly used biodiesel blends. In current study, the kinetic mechanism of n-decane/&#945;-methylnaphthalene (AMN)/methyl-decanoate (MD) blend is developed and validated as the surrogate for biodiesel/diesel blends. The IDEA reference fuel (70% n-decane/30% AMN by liquid volume) was formulated in the past as a two-component diesel surrogate fuel. A comprehensive and compact oxidation model for the IDEA reference fuel is developed. One important fuel-fuel interaction pathway via reaction pathway of A2CH2 + HO2 is observed and detailed discussed. The IDEA blends are validated by comprehensive target experiments for n-decane, AMN, and the AMN/n-decane blends. Ignition delay times, flame speeds, and species composition in jet stirred reactor and counter flow flames are successfully simulated for a broad range of temperatures (500-2000 K) and pressures (1-50 bar). The simulations of the IDEA blend with current mod-el show acceptable agreement when compared with different experiments of ignition delay times for diesel fuels as well as flame speed experiments. With a chain of ten carbon atoms and a methyl-ester group attached, MD is considered as a one-component surrogate fuel for biodiesel. A comprehensive and compact kinetic model for MD is developed. The mechanism is critically tested by comparison of model predictions with experimental data over a wide temperature (500 to 1500 K) and pressure (1 to 20 bar) range and for different fuel/oxidizer ratios. The good maintenance of chemical information during the reduction has been confirmed by simulation results, as well as the sensitivity and flow analyses performed using the detailed and the skeletal model. The MD model is compared with available experimental ignition delay times of biodiesel fuels. The good agreement between the simulations and the experiments proves that this model is a reliable kinetic model for simulations, either used by itself or in combination with IDEA blend. To improve the mechanism analysis, this thesis introduces a new three-stage reactive flow analysis. The final skeletal n-decane/AMN/MD blend with skeletal base mechanism includes 295 species and 3500 reactions by using the CGR approach. Based on the above validations and comparisons, current blend is considered as one surrogate for biodiesel/diesel blends that is suitable for improving kinetic understanding and for application in engine simulations.",,"Wang, Xiaoxiao",2017,,,OPUS4-4668,Dissertation

Improving goodput and reliability of ultra-high-speed wireless communication at data link layer level,,"The design of 100 Gbps wireless networks is a challenging task. A serial Reed-Solomon decoder at the targeted data rate has to operate at ultra-fast clock frequency of 12.5 GHz to fulfill timing constraints of the transmission. Receiving a single Ethernet frame on the physical layer may be faster than accessing DDR3 memory. Moreover, data link layer of wireless systems has to cope with high bit error rate (BER). The BER in wireless communication can be several orders of magnitude higher than in wired systems. For example, the IEEE 802.3ba standard for 100 Gbps Ethernet limits the BER to 1e-12 at the data link layer. On the contrary, the BER of high-speed wireless RF-frontend working in the Terahertz band might be higher than 1e-3. Performing forward error correction on the state of the art FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) and ASICs requires a highly parallelized approach. Thus, new processing concepts have to be developed for fast wireless communication. Due to the mentioned factors, the data link layer for the wireless 100G communication has to be considered as new research, and cannot be adopted from other systems. This work provides a detailed case study about 100 Gbps data link layer design with the main focus on communication reliability improvements for ultra-high-speed wireless communication. Firstly, constraints of available hardware platforms are identified (memory capacity, memory access time, and logic area). Later, simulation of popular techniques used for data link layer optimizations are presented (frame fragmentation, frames aggregation, forward error correction, acknowledge frame compression, hybrid automatic repeat request, link adaptation, selective fragment retransmission). After that, data link layer FPGA accelerator processing ~116 Gbps of user data is presented. At the end, ASIC synthesis is considered and detailed statistics of consumed energy per bit are introduced. The research includes link adaptation techniques, which optimize goodput and consumed energy according to the channel BER. To the author's best knowledge, it is the first published data link layer implementation dedicated for 100 Gbps wireless communication shown anywhere in the world.",,"Lopacinski, Lukasz",2017,,,OPUS4-4127,Dissertation
Secure Scan Chain and Debug Interface,,"Cryptographic operations are more and more popular because unencrypted information is a security leakage in many application areas. Possible ways to get the secret key is the misuse of test and debug facilities. These interfaces allow a reading and writing access to all internals of the ASIC. Typically they are not protected against a misuse by a third party. In this thesis a new countermeasure against side channel attacks on scan chain and debug interfaces is proposed. The countermeasure for the scan chain interface, as well as the one for the debug interface, use the same approach, but every interface has its own security component. The approach designed and investigated in this thesis is based on a key matching method, which is resistant against reverse engineering. It is necessary from the user side, to test and debug the device, to write the secret key in an OTP. The ""golden"" key is embedded in specially designed units, which are used to compare the golden key with one provided in the OTP. After testing or the debugging, the key in the OTP is deleted. Even if this key is known to an attacker, it is not possible to rewrite the value into the OTP. The unit which contains golden key and compare logic is made of digital standard cells. The cells are not modified, but the wiring has a novelty. Small isolation elements from the analog circuit design are used to implement a ""0"" or a ""1"" as value for the golden key. The security feature is the resistance against optical reverse engineering because both types of the golden key and compare unit have the same footprint. Finally 128 of these units compose the 128 bit golden key. The scan chain solution is suitable for any IP core, independent of whether it is a standalone cryptographic component, a microcontroller or a very complex system on a chip. For the scan chain test the test pattern generated by the scan pattern generator can be used without any modification. The only requirement is that before the test, the secret key has to be written into the device, and after the test, the secret key has to be deleted. For a debug interface the same problem exists as for the scan chain interface. An access to the device is an open door for an attacker. As the debug interface is used in different development stages the approach is to implement several OTP lines - one per development stage for example. Additionally a mechanism for different access levels is offered. Depending of the access level different address spaces are unlocked. As shown in this thesis, the solutions for a secure scan and debug interface are easy to integrate into an existing design, while area, timing and power is not influenced significantly. The scan or debug process have to be changed only slightly and the test coverage is not affected and defect analysis is possible. To summarize in this thesis a novel and innovative approach to protect scan and debug interfaces against side channel attacks was designed and evaluated.",,"Vater, Frank",2017,,,OPUS4-4293,Dissertation
Thermodynamic modeling and experimental investigations of high temperature corrosion and oxidation due to increased power plant cycling,,"With the rapid growth of renewable energy sources (RES) in the power generation mix in accordance with the German energy transition policy ('Energiewende'), fewer baseload coal power plants will be required. Future power generation will be supplied through decentralized power utilities such as off-shore wind parks and also through high operational flexibility of existing conventional coal power units. High operational flexibility means conventional power plants have to increase cyclic operations to cope with feed-ins from variable-RES such as wind and solar. Unlike medium and peak load power plants that can react quickly to load changes and power ramps, baseload power plants are not suited for such operations. Important technical requirements for flexible operation include among others; frequent start-ups and shut-downs, a minimum downtime, shorter startup time and short operational periods. Baseload coal power plants however do not meet these requirements. This increased cyclic mode of operation can have severe impacts on vital power plant components such as superheater and reheater tubes resulting in high temperature cyclic oxidation/corrosion especially because these plants were not designed for frequent cyclic operations. To optimize plant operations, minimize material damage and reduce operational and maintenance cost, it is therefore important to understand the oxidation and corrosion risk to plants materials associated with this flexible mode of operation. In this context, thermochemical modeling in FactSage 6.4&#7488;&#7481; as well as experimental investigations were carried out. For the experimental investigations, five commercial coal boiler superheater and reheater materials, namely T91, VM12-SHC, TP347-HFG, DMV304 HCu and DMV310 N were exposed for 1000 hours under discontinuous isothermal oxidation conditions and 1000 hours thermo-cyclic oxidation conditions at a metal surface temperature of 650 °C. The synthetic corrosive flue gas consisted of a mixture of CO&#8322;, O&#8322;, SO&#8322;, N&#8322; and H&#8322;O. The test material samples were partly covered in fly ash to investigate the effect ash deposits on the corrosion and oxidation behavior of the test materials. After exposure metallographic analysis by means of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (LOM and SEM-EDS) were carried out to study the oxide morphology and micro-structural properties of the materials. The oxidation kinetics (weight change) results showed significant oxide growth rates (weight gain) under cyclic oxidation conditions especially in the martensitic alloys - T91, VM12-SHC. Furthermore, metallographic analysis revealed severe oxide spallation in the ash covered sections of these alloys. The austenitic materials (TP374-HFG, DMV310 N) with the exception of DMV304 HCu showed good oxidation behavior with minimal oxide growth both under isothermal and thermal cyclic conditions. However, severe grain boundary attack and internal sulphidation were found in these alloys. DMV310 N showed the best corrosion and oxidation performance. The thermochemical modeling calculations supported the experimental results.",,"Abang, Roger Atini",2016,,,OPUS4-4003,Dissertation
Fully monolithically integrated X-band amplifiers with frequency selective feedback,,"The thesis addresses the design of monolithically integrated radio frequency amplifiers for X-band applications. The focus is on low-voltage low-noise amplifiers and efficient power amplifiers with high output power level. The challenge here is to realize stable amplifiers with remarkable performance metrics at low supply voltages. The general approach for stabilization amplifiers in the above frequency range is the use of a cascode topology which, however, requests higher supply voltages then single transistor operation. By using a special passive frequency-selective feedback, the use of the cascode topology could be avoided, and the amplifiers are stabilized over the entire frequency spectrum. Simultaneously, this feedback is used to neutralize the intrinsic feedback of the transistor at operating frequencies. As a result, a frequency dependent performance degeneration of the transistor can be mitigated. This work describes the influence of the passive frequency-selective feedback. Its usage as well its limitation are explained using the examples of a realized low noise amplifier and different power amplifiers. Further, the design of radio frequency amplifiers at X-band frequencies that employs silicon-germanium heterojunction bipolar transistors is described. All amplifiers were either incorporated in a 0.25 µm SiGe:C BiCMOS technology or in a 0.35 µm SiGe:C bipolar technology. The main achievements of this work include: - A 8.7 GHz narrow-band low noise amplifier incorporated in a 0.35 µm SiGe bipolar technology. The noise figure is 2.2 dB and the gain 28 dB at a supply voltage of 3 V. The low noise amplifier was subsequently used for a design of a double-balanced I/Q mixer. - Two packaged high efficient power amplifiers operating at a center frequency of 12 GHz. They are incorporated in a 0.35 µm SiGe bipolar technology. One amplifier uses a transformer-based output matching network and achieves 30.9 % of power-added efficiency and 23.9 dBm of maximum output power at a supply voltage of 1.8 V. The second amplifier utilizes an LC-balun for impedance matching at the output and a power-added-efficiency of 38 % at 1.8 V is measured. The maximum output power was 23.4 dBm. - A power amplifier in a 0.35 µm SiGe bipolar technology that uses power combining techniques to achieve 30 dBm (1 W) and 30 % of power-added efficiency at 10 GHz and 2 V supply voltage. - Two power amplifiers, incorporated in a 0.25 µm SiGe:C BiCMOS technology, demonstrating the capability of a non-advanced SiGe process to be used for radio frequency power applications. Power combining techniques, the use of the passive frequency-selective feedback and layout optimization enables the realization of power amplifiers which exhibit an output power of 30 dBm and a power-added efficiency of 35 % at supply voltages lower as 2.6 V.",,"Gerlich, Stefan",2016,,,OPUS4-3925,Dissertation

Multimodal approach for the numerical simulation of ultrasonic guided waves in cylindrical structures of non-constant thickness,,"Guided waves hold great potential for applications in the field of ultrasonic nondestructive testing. Examples of possible applications are the ultrasonic testing and structural health monitoring of wheelset-axles as used in trains. Depending on the particular type, these axles can be described as either thick cylindrical rods or thick walled hollow cylinders with varying thickness. Wheelset-axles are safety relevant components that have to be inspected on a regular basis. The use of guided waves would allow a full inspection while accessing only the front faces of the axle, thus potentially speeding up the inspection procedure. In order to develop such an inspection technique, however, detailed knowledge of wave propagation through the axle is required. Established mesh-based procedures, like the finite element method, could be used to simulate guided wave propagation in such structures. However, due to the size of the axle itself and the comparatively fine mesh that is dictated by the wavelengths usually applied in ultrasonic testing, these mesh-based procedures would be very expensive in terms of computation times. The multimodal approach seems to be a very promising alternative that can be expected to provide results significantly faster. The multimodal method uses the guided wave modes of a corresponding waveguide with a constant cross-section as basis in which the local sound field at any given position in a waveguide with varying thickness can be expressed. Thereby the numerical effort is reduced to solving the one dimensional differential equations that govern the evolution of the coefficients in the mode spectrum along the waveguide. Once the sound field has been calculated, a time dependence can easily be included, which allows the simulation of pulse propagation through the waveguide. In this thesis, the multimodal approach, as described for the calculation of Lamb-waves in plates with non-constant thickness, is extended to other types of elastic waveguides such as cylindrical rods and thick walled hollow cylinders. For the sake of simplicity, investigations are restricted to axially symmetric wave modes. The results obtained with the multimodal approach are validated against FEM-simulations. It is shown that the multimodal method potentially holds a great advantage in terms of computation time over commercially available software based on the finite element method. Finally, the multimodal method is evaluated with respect to possible future applications on wheelset-axles.",,"Höhne, Christian",2016,,,OPUS4-4125,Dissertation

Multidimensional visualization of preferential flow pathways using neutron and x-ray radiation,,"The occurrence of preferential flow of water in soils is rather the rule than the exception particularly in heterogeneous structured soils. The quantitative prediction is difficult because of the spatial as well as temporal variability. One aim of the dissertation was to visualize the soil structure and flow patterns in mine soils using a combination of neutron radiography, neutron tomography and x-ray computed tomography experiments. Both radiation techniques were used to describe preferential pathways as a soil structure with CT and the process of preferential flow of water with NT. For the first time neutron radiation was applied on undisturbed soil cores to visualize water distributions in natural soils on three examples for heterogeneities of different origin. In a first investigation we used neutron radiography to analyze the moisture distribution in undisturbed slab-type and cylindrical samples of mine soils containing lignitic fragments and inclined soil layers. 2D radiography sequences indicated that flow pathways are highly dependent on the shape, distribution, and internal structure of the lignitic fragments. For 3D experiments, the quantitative analysis of water contents failed due to a pronounced beam hardening effect. The tensiometer data indicated the existence of local non-equilibrium in pressure heads between fragments and matric pore regions. The objective of the second study was to analyze and visualize the effects of initial soil structure formation at the surface of bare soils in an artificial hydrological catchment that has been left to undirected ecological succession for three years. The three-dimensional (3D) micro-morphology was described using the X-ray computed tomography (CT); two-dimensional (2D) infiltration patterns were obtained from drip infiltration experiments using time-resolved neutron radiography (NT). The analyses of CT data indicate the existence of (i) structural crusts on soil consisting of sandy to loamy sediments and (ii) depositional crusts on sandy sediments. The results of combined observations using CT and NT suggest that the initial soil surface structure alterations of young sandy sediment modify moisture patterns of infiltrating water only slightly. The aim of the 3rd experiment was to study effect of two 'ecological engineers', moss vegetation and beetle larvae on pore structure and infiltration. The soil pore structure was characterized by micro-computed tomography analyses of bare soil, sparse and dense moss-vegetated samples containing a single burrow. Flow patterns of infiltration experiments were visualized using the neutron radiography technique. The results of this study suggest that moss vegetation and burrowing activity of ground beetles strongly control the initial soil development by modification of pore structure and surface water infiltration.",,"Badorreck, Annika",2016,,,OPUS4-4161,Dissertation
A secure isolation of software activities in Tiny Scale Systems,,"With the introduction of the Internet at the end of the last century the modern society was fundamentally changed. Computer systems became an element of nearly all parts of our daily live. Due to the interconnection of these systems local borders are mostly vanished, so that information is accessible and exchangeable anywhere and at anytime. But this increased connectivity causes that physical fences are no longer an adequate protection for computer systems. Whereas the security of commodity computer systems was improved continuously and similarly with their increased connectivity, deeply embedded systems were then and now mostly protected by physical fences. But the ubiquitous availability of embedded systems in personal and commercial environments makes these systems likewise accessible and moves them strongly into the focus of security investigations. Deeply embedded systems are usually equipped with tiny scale micro controllers, which are limited in their available resources and do not feature secure mechanisms to isolate system resources. Hence, a single error in a local software component is not limited to the component itself, instead the complete system may be influenced. The lack of resource isolation makes tiny scale systems prone for accidental errors but in particular vulnerable for a broad variety of malicious software. For a safe and secure operation of computer systems it is strongly recommended that software components are isolated in such a manner that they have access only to those resources, which are assigned to them. Even though a substantial number of approaches in the context of embedded system's safety were investigated during the last fifteen years, security was mostly neglected. This thesis is focused on security aspects where malicious software wittingly tries to bypass available protection mechanisms. The thesis introduces a security platform for tiny scale systems that enforces an isolation of software components considering security aspects. Due to the limited resources of tiny scale systems the proposed solution is based on a co-design process that takes the static and predefined nature of deeply embedded systems into account and includes hardware, compile-time, and run-time partitions to reduce the number of additional run-time components, to avoid performance drawbacks, and to minimize the memory as well as the components footprint overhead. To prove the applicability of the presented platform it was applied and evaluated with two real applications. In addition, an investigation of technologies of commodity computer systems that are suitable to build secure systems is presented. The thesis analyzes their enforcement based on the features provided by the introduced security platform. The contributions of this thesis include an enforcement of a security isolation of system resources on tiny scale systems and enable the development of a broad variety of secure tiny scale system applications.",,"Stecklina, Oliver",2016,,,OPUS4-4036,Dissertation
"Analysis and optimization of interfaces in ""wide-gap"" chalcopyrite-based thin film solar cell devices",,"The chemical and electronic structure of chalcopyrite absorbers with different bulk band gap energies, Egbulk, [i.e., low-gap Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe, Egbulk ~ 1.2 eV) and wide-gap CuInS2 (CIS, Egbulk ~ 1.5 eV)] and of buffer/absorber heterointerfaces based on these materials are studied with soft and hard x-ray spectroscopy techniques. Mechanisms that benefit (limit) the performance of low(wide)-gap chalcopyrite-based solar cells are identified. This knowledge is used to develop surface tailoring treatments to optimize buffer/absorber heterointerfaces based on wide-gap chalcopyrites and improve the performance of their solar cells. Photoemission spectroscopy (PES) characterization of the two absorbers (i.e., CIGSe and CIS) reveal compositional-depth profiles. The changes detected in CIGSe include: a near surface Ga-depletion, a strongly Cu-poor surface and a strong presence of surface Na that (likely) occupies Cu vacancies. A similar Cu-deficiency is found in CIS. The depth-composition changes result in significant widening of the band gap at the surface, Egsurf, (i.e., CIGSe, Egsurf: 1.70 ± 0.2 eV and CIS, Egsurf: 1.88 ± 0.2 eV) as evident by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES) measurements. Differences in the interaction of the CIGSe and CIS surfaces with deposited buffer materials are identified. PES and modified Auger parameter studies reveal strong intermixing at the CdS/CIGSe and ZnS/CIGSe heterointerfaces. S L2,3 x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements of CIGSe substrates submitted to CdS chemical bath deposition (CBD-CdS) treatments show the formation of In2S3 and defect-rich/nanostructured CdS at the interface, compounds with higher band gap values than the measured Egsurf for CIGSe. S L2,3 XES spectra of CIGSe substrates submitted to CBD-ZnS treatments reveal the formation of (Zn,In)(S,Se)2 chemical analogs at the interface. PES and XES measurement series show that the CdS/CIS heterointerface is more abrupt, with no detected interface chemical species. Direct measurement of the band alignment of these heterointerfaces reveals: an ideal conduction band offset (CBO) configuration for CdS/CIGSe (i.e., CBO: +0.11 ± 0.25 eV), a spike CBO configuration for ZnS/CIGSe (i.e., CBO: +1.06 ± 0.4 eV), and a highly unfavorable cliff CBO configuration for CdS/CIS (i.e., CBO: -0.42 ± 0.25 eV). The performance of solar cell devices based on these heterointerfaces is correlated to their CBO configuration. Two surface tailoring approaches intended to correct the CBO configuration of the CdS/CIS heterointerface are presented. One method is based on rapid thermal processing (RTP) selenization treatments of CIS absorbers, aiming to exchange Se for S in treated samples. The idea behind this approach is to modify the surface of a wide-gap chalcopyrite so that it forms a more favorable heterointerface with CdS, such as heterointerfaces within low-gap chalcopyrite devices. X-ray fluorescence analysis and PES measurements of RTP-treated CIS samples show a greater treatment effect at the surface of the sample compared to the bulk (i.e., surface [Se]/[S+Se] range: 0.23 ± 0.05 to 0.83 ± 0.05, compared to bulk [Se]/[S+Se] range: 0.01 ± 0.03 to 0.24 ± 0.03). Tuning of the Cu:In:(S+Se) surface composition from a Cu-poor 1:3:5 to a 1:1:2 stoichiometry is observed in RTP-treated CIS samples with lower to higher surface Se contents, respectively. UPS measurements show a shift in valence band maximum toward the Fermi level in samples with higher surface Se content (i.e., -0.88 ± 0.1 to -0.51 ± 0.1 eV), as expected for a reduction in Egsurf due to exchange of Se for S. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry reveals a reduction in the optical band gap of samples with greater Se incorporation (i.e., from 1.47 ± 0.05 to 1.08 ± 0.05 eV), allowing for a working window for optimization purposes. The second tailoring method involves surface functionalization of CIS absorbers with dipole-charge-inducing self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of benzoic acid derivatives and thiol molecules. The introduction of dipole charges between a heterointerface can tune the relative alignment of the electronic bands composing its electronic structure; thus, use of a suitable dipole-inducing SAM could correct the CBO misalignment in the CdS/CIS heterointerface. UPS measurements of the secondary electron cut-off region of CIS samples treated with a selected set of SAMs show a work function modulation of CIS (i.e., 4.4 ± 0.2 eV - 5.2 ± 0.2 eV). Small gains in solar cell parameters of solar cells based on SAM-modified heterointerfaces are measured. An overview of the performance of chalcopyrite(kesterite)-based solar cells in relation to the electronic properties of their corresponding buffer/absorber heterointerface suggests that optimization approaches extending beyond the buffer/absorber heterointerface may be needed for further performance gains in wide-gap chalcopyrite-based solar cell devices.",,"Felix Duarte, Roberto",2016,,,OPUS4-3740,Dissertation
Application of ODT to turbulent combustion problems in incompressible and compressible regimes,,"The one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model is applied to a reactant - to - product counterflow configuration as well as to a shock tube configuration in non-reactive flow and in deflagration and detonation regimes. The model employed herein solves conservation equations for momentum, energy, and species on a one dimensional (1D) domain corresponding to the line spanning the domain between nozzle orifice centers in the counterflow configuration and corresponding to the tube length in the shock tube configuration. The effects of turbulent mixing are modeled via a stochastic process, while the Kolmogorov and reactive length and time scales are explicitly resolved. In the counterflow configuration, comparisons between model and DNS results for spatial mean and root-mean-square (RMS) velocity, temperature, and major and minor species profiles are shown. The ODT approach shows qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable agreement with the DNS data. Scatter plots and statistics conditioned on temperature are also compared for heat release rate and all species. ODT is able to capture the range of results depicted by DNS. However, conditional statistics show signs of underignition. To carry out the shock tube simulations, the ODT methodology is extended to include an efficient compressible implementation and a model for capturing shock-induced turbulence is presented. The necessary algorithmic changes to include compressibility effects are highlighted and the model for capturing shock-turbulence interaction is presented. To validate the compressible solver, results for Sod's shock tube problem are compared against a finite volume Riemann solver. To validate the model for shock-turbulence interaction, comparisons for a non-reactive and a reactive case are presented. First, results of a shock traveling from light (air) to heavy (SF6) with reshock have been simulated to match mixing width growth data of experiments and turbulent kinetic energy results from LES. Then, for one-step chemistry calibrated to represent an acetylene/air mixture, the interaction of a shock wave with an expanding flame front is simulated, and results with 2D simulation (2D-sim) data for flame brush formation and ensuing deflagration-to-detonation transitions (DDT) are compared. Results for the Sod shock tube comparison show that the shock speed and profile are captured accurately. Results for the nonreactive shock-reshock problem show that interface growth at all simulated Mach numbers is captured accurately and that the turbulent kinetic energy agrees in order of magnitude with LES data. The reactive shock tube results show that the flame brush thickness compares well to 2D-sim data and that the approximate location and timing of the DDT can be captured. The known sensitivity of DDT characteristics to details of individual Wow realizations, seen also in ODT, implies that model agreement can be quantified only by comparing Wow ensembles, which are presently unavailable other than in an ODT run-to-run sensitivity study that is reported herein.",,"Jozefik, Zoltan",2016,,,OPUS4-3865,Dissertation
Optimization of nitrogen removal in various vertical flow constructed wetland designs and application of treated wastewater for reuse in irrigation in Jordan,,"In arid countries, reclaimed water in irrigation is a widespread practice. Therefore, robust treatment designs are prerequisite to obtain effluent quality that conforms to the legal requirements for reuse and health standards. Vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) are attractive decentralized treatment plants in many countries and communities. VFCWs are capable of providing adequate treatment for organic and solids removal, even though there are limitations on nutrient and pathogen removal. Within this study, various VFCW systems were investigated, in Germany and Jordan, to optimize nitrogen removal using sustainable and low cost options to guarantee the safe reuse in Jordan. In Germany at Langenreichenbach research facility, two-stage VFCWs planted (Phragmites australis) and unplanted were evaluated and modified to compare the role of plants over two years. Generally, there was no significant role of plants on the treatment performance. Both systems showed high removal efficiency for TOC, BOD5, and TSS over the study period. During the first year of the study, effluent TN concentrations ranged from 60 - 61 mg/L in both systems as a result of high effluent NO3--N concentrations (50 - 52 mg/L). In the second year, the systems were modified, adopting a saturated layer in the 1st stage to enhance denitrification. Average effluent TN concentrations were reduced to 45 mg/L in both systems. In addition, during modifications, the E.coli removal was enhanced in both systems achieving 4 log reduction instead of 2 log reduction during the first year of the study. In Jordan at the Fuhais research facility, two VFCW systems were studied considering category-A (TN: 45 mg/L and NO3-N: 30 mg/L) in the Jordanian Standards for reuse in irrigation (JS 893/2006). Recirculating (ECO-1) and Multi-stage (ECO-2) VFCW designs have shown high removal efficiency of COD, TSS, and BOD5 over three years of monitoring. ECO-1 system combines simultaneous nitrification and denitrification by recycling portion of nitrified effluent into the recirculation tank. However, effluent TN and NO3--N concentrations were 55 and 44 mg/L, respectively, that the system conformed to the JS category-B (TN: 70 mg/L and NO3-N: 45 mg/L) during monitoring phase. Therefore, ECO-1 was modified by installing plastic media in the recirculation tank that attached growth increases the abundance and activity of microorganisms. TN concentration was reduced effectively of 40 mg/L, conforming to the JS category-A, whereas, NO3--N concentration was reduced to 37 mg/L, conforming to the JS category-B. However, over the study period, E.coli concentrations were conformed to the JS category-C (more than 1000 MPN/100 mL). ECO-2 consists of two unsaturated VFCWs in series; single-pass unplanted filter followed by planted filter (Phragmites australis). E.coli removal was relatively high before modification that the effluent conformed to the JS (category-B: 1000 MPN/100 mL), achieving 4.4 log reduction. The effluent TN and NO3--N concentrations did not conform to the JS of 77 and 76 mg/L, respectively, due to insufficiency of carbon source to promote denitrification (high BOD5 removal) during monitoring phase of the study. Thus, ECO-2 was modified adopting raw wastewater step-feeding strategy that a specific volume of raw wastewater was mixed with 1st stage effluent in the mixing tank. TN and NO3--N concentrations were reduced to 52 and 50 mg/L, respectively; conforming to the JS category-B. Whereas, E.coli removal was influenced by E.coli ingress from raw step-feeding, achieving 3.5 log reduction, conforming to the JS category-C. The short-term impact of irrigation with different water quality and quantity was investigated at the Fuhais site. Soil physicochemical and biological properties in three parallel experimental reuse plots were investigated. The plots were cultivated with lemon trees and were irrigated via a subsurface irrigation system. Moreover, each plot was divided into two subparts (A and B) whereby one part received 11 mm/day of irrigation water and the other received 6 mm/day. Using treated effluent and tap water showed the same trend of increased soli salinity (ECs). Significant difference in ECs, SAR, Mg+2, Ca+2, and Na+ were observed at 0-20 cm as a result of high evaporation and capillary rise that increased salts accumulation in the topsoil. However, using more water reduced the salts accumulation in sub soil layers due to continuous leaching. Whereas, results showed no significant variation in soil texture, structure, moisture, and infiltration rate among reuse plots and subparts. Additionally, results revealed an absence of total coliform, fecal coliform, and E.coli in the irrigated soils, indicating the effectiveness of using subsurface irrigation as a disinfection step for reuse.",,"Abdallat, Ghaida",2016,,,OPUS4-3798,Dissertation
Geomorphic processes associated with Small-Scale Opencast Mining and mitigation measures: case study of the Gatumba Mining District in the Western Highlands of Rwanda,,"This thesis deals with geomorphic processes associated with Small-Scale Opencast Mining (SSOM) in the Gatumba sector of the Western Highlands of Rwanda. In this area tin and tantalum mining was carried out for decades, and it has brought about increase in the wealth and standard of living of the people. Though a lot has been done and achieved in soil erosion research, and despite the enormous wealth coming from mining in Rwanda and Gatumba sector in particular, the negative environmental impacts resulting from mining activities were overlooked by miners and stakeholders and are scarcely addressed in the research yet. This trend was bound to last since there were no valid guidelines for assessing impacts and reclamation of mine sites for the operators in the sector. It was recently, in 2007, that restoration of mining areas has received great attention from the Rwanda Geology and Mine Authority. The objective of the research was to assess and to increase the understanding of geomorphic impact produced by SSOM. In this regards, the following aspects which indicate the types and spatial distribution of geomorphic processes were measured: (i) investigate the landforms typical of SSOM, (ii) map the watershed morphometry of the study area, (iii) analyse the most relevant properties of soils in term of geomorphology, and (iv) to assess the soil loss potential in the study area. Primary and secondary data were collected from Government agencies and personal observations. Desk study to review papers and relevant literatures, field observation and experiments, laboratory analyses, mapping and modelling using RUSLE were combined together to develop a practical and integrated methodological approach to effect and realize the objectives. The argument guiding this analytical approach is that physical processes produced by mining cannot be assessed through a single method. The first step mainly concentrated on defining mining sites suitable for assessing geomorphic processes. Within the two studied mines, namely Ruhanga and Gatare, different plots were identified based on the post-mining land uses, to investigate the level of soil and landscape degradation by comparing them with that of control sites located outside of mining influence. Modelling using RUSLE in GIS interface enabled to quantify soil loss potential within the mines and the watershed. Results indicate that the direct processes associated with opencast mining commonly involve pitting and trenching. Indirect and less conspicuous processes emerge as a long-term consequence of mining. They include depletion of organic matter, compaction or loosening of soil particles in mine sites mostly reflected by low content in organic matter, low rating in soil stable aggregates, and often high soil bulk densities which are variably distributed within the mine sites. This could explain the restriction or lowering, or the rapid infiltration of water into the soil during field experiments, as a consequence probably of the sealing of soil pores or the formation of fissures around mine shafts, from which slides or slumps occur. In average, soil organic matter comprises between 1 and 2.5 % on control sites and ex-mine cultivated sites. organic matter content of soils on reclamation sites was in the same ranges with that of control and ex-mine cultivated sites, but could reach 4,8 % in topsoil of some sample locations. The ex-mine self-recovering sites present much lower organic matter content which doesn't exceed 2 % in general. The soil aggregation rating of the area is from very low (8%) to low (&#8804;13.5 %). In general, the bulk density ranges between 1.29 to 1.56 g cm-3, and locally can attain 1.76 g cm-3. As a consequence, the total porosity changes locally. Application of correlation and multiple regression models showed a strong influence of soil organic matter on the bulk density. Infiltration tests performed on different experimental sites showed differences of rates in water intake rates as in infiltration curves as well. Infiltration rates are variably distributed over the mines. They range from very slow (3.8 mmhr-1) to rapid (111.18 mm hr-1). Atterberg Limits analyses showed that soils of Gatumba Mining District do not possess extreme properties and they are suitable for engineering purposes. The liquid limit ranges between 51 % and 26 %, whereas the plastic limit is comprised between 22 % and 18 %. The highest plastic index (PI) determined was 29 % and the later soil had a plastic index of 6 %. The average soil loss in the Gatumba watershed is 27.45 t ha-1 yr-1 with a standard deviation of 0.891. More than 65% of land are prone to high rates of soil loss (exceeding 10 t ha-1 yr-1), and an increasing soil erosion follows increasing slope and land use patterns. The maxima of soil erosion rates are found in Upper Kibilira, Kirombozi and Gisuma catchments respectively. Based on different scenarios applied to quantify soil erosion rates, we found that more the organic matter content from 0. 5%, 2% and >2%) is increased with better support practice (from contour, strip and terrace), more the soil erosion potentials are decreased linearly, in the order of 18.8 to 17.8 t ha-1 yr-1 from 2% to >2 % of organic matter content respectively. To make SSOM more environmentally sustainable, there is a need of developing integrated practices and cross-cutting approaches that reduce the environmental impact of mining operations, and leave mine sites in an acceptable state for reuse by people or systems. Practices such as isolation of soil and earth material, stabilization of slopes and amendments of sites to be restored should be highly considered in the process of rehabilitation of affected sites.",,"Byizigiro, Rutazuyaza Vaillant",2016,,,OPUS4-3677,Dissertation
Hygienization of enteropathogens contaminated biowaste for safer biological treatments,,"In this study, the aims were to investigate the die-off levels of pathogens attainable under conventional biotreatments, introduce alternative hygienization options and study their performance at eliminating pathogens from biowaste. In addition, the study investigated feasibility of biotreatment of potato peels waste (PPW) as management option for the peels waste generated in Dar es Salaam city. Pathogens inactivation studies using simulated biowaste (moisture &#707;77%w/w) composed of PPW spiked with Escherichia coli and Salmonella senftenbergensis at laboratory-scale resulted into low temperature-time patterns of the aerobic In-vessel composting system and turned the process anaerobic thus demonstrated inefficiency at eliminating the spiked bacteria. Likewise, two-phase anaerobic digestion at continuous stirred tank reactor confirmed incapable at effecting complete inactivation of the bacteria unless substrate residence is prolonged above 72hrs. These distasteful confirmations inevitably advocate the importance of applying either pre- and/or post-biotreatment hygienization processes on biowaste for safer biotreatments. Existing hygienization options including acid/lime conditioning and batch pasteurization were applied, their hygienization efficacy investigated and the latter validated. Acetic acid treatment of biowaste at pH value 4 for 5days or lime treatment at pH value 11-12 for 1day brought complete die-off in E. coli and S. senftenbergensis. Temperature-time combination at 65°C for 30min was sufficient at effecting &#707;1log cycle die-off of the spiked enteropathogens with z-Value of 11&#730;C for S. senftenbergensis hence validates the temperature-time regime of 70&#730;C for 30min and 70&#730;C for 60min set by U.S-EPA/625/R-92/013 and Regulations (EC) No. 208/2006 respectively. In addition, alternative hygienization options namely UV radiation and passive solar heating (PSH) were proposed, applied and evaluated. Modes of application and achievable bacteria die-off for all hygienization options are given in Chapter 2 to 6 of this document. Owing to its small investment capital (mostly do yourself construction), independence from fuel supplies and low running costs, the study highly recommend PSH as environmental friendly and economic viable pre- and post- biotreatment hygienization option especially for tropical climates and developing countries with adequate sunshine. In vessel co-composting of PPW with yard-waste at 6:1 ratio gave microbiologically safe and good quality compost. Endowed with higher CO2 removal, mesophilic/thermophilic two-phase anaerobic processing of PPW showed comparable results to biogasification from other biowaste. Biogas productivity from PPW was 2.3lNbiogas/l.day with an average CH4 yield of 0.13-0.35m3/kgoTS input having 58% CH4. The digestion resulted into H2S removal from above LoQ to less than 230ppm with 81% VS removal at substrate OLR of 2.4kgoTS/m3.day input without sign of inhibition. It is estimated that 1.0m3biogas with 5hrs burning potential and equivalent to 3.5kg firewood can be produced from 10.2kg of PPW anaerobic digested. The resulting biogas production would complement household energy need thus conserve forest resources which are subjected to high deforestation rate estimated at 4.1kilotons of wood per day as fuelwood. Digestate resulting from the anaerobic reactors would make valuable fertilizer to urban agriculture thus enhance soil fertility and productivity.",,"Muhondwa, Jacob Paul",2016,,,OPUS4-3952,Dissertation
"Inertial wave attractors, resonances, and wave excitation by libration : direct numerical simulations and theory",,"Resonance phenomena are ubiquitous in Nature. Resonance means that a system can accumulate large amounts of kinetic energy. In rotating flows inertial waves provide a mechanism for resonance by redistributing momentum, kinetic energy and helicity. In order to investigate inertial waves a Taylor-Couette system was investigated which consists of a homogeneous liquid confined between two coaxial cylinders and two rigid lids. The inner cylinder is slightly conical (frustum) to break the vertical mirror symmetry. Inertial waves were excited by two different forcing configurations: the frustum in libration and the lids together with the outer cylinder in libration. Libration means that the rotation rate of the wall is modulated with a fixed amplitude and frequency of the order of the mean rotation rate. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) were conducted with a numerical solver in terrain-following coordinates. DNS results reveal that inertial wave excitation is localised at the edges of the confinement, which is in very good agreement with recent laboratory measurements of Seelig (2014, PhD thesis, BTU Cottbus - Senftenberg). A model of the wave excitation mechanism was developed with the aid of boundary layer theory. The model suggests that a difference in the boundary layer mass flux (Ekman flux) excites the waves by driving an excess Ekman pumping velocity at the edges. The DNS results exhibit this flux difference, and the simulated kinetic energy spectra of the waves exhibit the frequency dependency predicted by the model. However, DNS results also exhibit helical vortices at the edges which are not part of the model. Conservation properties suggest that these vortices are merely a compensating phenomenon which tends to stabilise the boundary layer flow. The details of this flow, however, appear less important for the wave excitation. Response spectra of the kinetic energy, the dissipation rate, the helicity, and the quality factor were computed in order to assess resonance conditions. Simulated resonance peaks have a width of only 1/20th of the mean rotation rate. At these peaks, the kinetic energy was found to increase by a factor 10-50 even though viscous forces were still rather large (Ekman number of the order 1/100,000 with the length scale given by the mean radial gap width). The flow patterns found at those resonances were investigated and found to be in very good agreement with the spatial patterns obtained by laboratory measurements and geometric ray tracing. The DNS results suggest that there are two types of resonance in rotating flows: modes and wave attractors. In contrast to a mode, a wave attractor exhibits net focusing of wave energy and occupies a finite frequency band. DNS results show that the wave attractor resonance frequency adjusts within the frequency band which suggests that wave attractor resonances complement 'classical' mode resonances and may, thus, be relevant in various applications.",,"Klein, Marten",2016,,,OPUS4-4171,Dissertation
Risk management of nanotechnologies within German legislation,,"Nanotechnologies allow for the production of completely new materials in a wide range of industries and technical fields and are also recognised as one of the most important technological sectors for the future. The growing nanotechnological industry is rapidly generating new forms of materials; however, little is known about the behaviour of these substances, in particular their particle form and their impact on different ecological systems and the life within them. Concerns have been raised about the safety and regulation of nanomaterials, following a number of studies that indicated that some nanomaterials are able to cause adverse effects on living objects. This data, as well as increasing production volumes and commercialisation, the capability of crossing biological barriers and the increased physico-chemical activities of nanoparticles, when compared to their bulk counterparts, have triggered concern (Baró et al., 2001; Kear et al., 2012) about their impacts on health and safety. In Germany, nanoparticles, nanotechnological products, their production processes and their disposal are generally subject to the prevailing law of the German legal system, especially with respect to the authorization of equipment, permissions regarding chemicals and other product groups, and the protection of employees and the environment. With regard to nanotechnologies, however, the question arises as to whether the present legal regulations are adequate, and/or whether regulative gaps occur because of specific new products, materials or process characteristics. Accordingly, based on the analysis of the relevant state-of-the-art technology and science, and an evaluation of existing, as well as projectable, future national legislation on this matter, this work aims to identify regulative gaps in the relevant standardisation procedures and to point out possible adjustments. Although nanomaterials are covered by the general scope of many of the existing legislative frameworks, it is often unclear if current regulation is actually applicable for specific questions of nanomaterials and their diverse applications. In particular, there is a lack of sufficient knowledge of the risks, which could lead to imbalanced legal protection against any threats that may arise. However, it is recognised that adjustments are needed, and legal amendments have been repeatedly proposed by expert committees, policymakers, industry members and non-governmental organisations (European Parliament, 2009). Nonetheless, very few revisions have been made to date, so the existing regulations are not considered adequate to deal with all kinds of nanomaterials in both the short and long term. Current legislation needs to be adapted immediately to reflect the challenges posed by current nanomaterials and their applications.",,"Goebelbecker, Joel",2016,,,OPUS4-4079,Dissertation
Influence of the German renewable energy and climate policies on onshore wind energy generation: Implementation options in Cameroon,,"The German government has set ambitious targets for wind energy expansion and has implemented policy schemes aimed at facilitating market deployment of wind-generated electricity. Data on German wind energy market has shown that, wind energy generating capacity is increasing correspondingly towards the targeted values. Germany is the largest wind energy market in the EU (wind energy accounting for about 10% of the total electricity consumption in Germany) with an installed capacity of about 38.2 GW onshore by the close of 2014. The success of these policies has prompted other countries globally to adopt similar support schemes for renewable energies. However, the rapid growth of wind energy generation in Germany equally faces numerous challenges. Some of these problems are inherent to the wind energy technology while others are caused by the very policies instruments used to support wind energy expansion, such as limited availability of designated areas for wind energy development, non-uniform regulations, and rising prices. The objective of this research, therefore, is to assess the impact of the German energy and environmental policies on onshore wind energy development and to explore implementation options of the German model in Cameroon. This research has examined the German onshore wind energy sector from a policy perspective based on existing literature, semi-structured interviews with major stakeholders, a case study of Brandenburg and a survey, with the aim of investigating the acceptance of wind energy and challenges the developers are facing. Based on the study results, it can be affirmed that the future growth of the German onshore market will come from flexible government policies, which may offer fewer incentives to investors. Indeed, the cost of electricity from renewable energy technologies in Germany is in some cases already below retail rates. There is the need, therefore, to pursue strategic programmes that enhances market integration of wind energy. Furthermore, the study results equally shows that the German feed-in tariff based support scheme in its current form, cannot be implemented in Cameroon. This is because, the purchasing power of the Cameroonian population and the economic constraints of the government, makes it difficult or even impossible to adopt the current EEG model in Cameroon where often, basic needs are subsidized.",,"Wanki Ateghang, Emmanuel",2016,,,OPUS4-3871,Dissertation
Simulative analysis of coloured extended stochastic Petri nets,,"Stochastic modelling of biochemical reaction networks is getting more and more popular. Throughout the past decades typical biological models increased in their size and complexity, because of advances in systems and molecular biology, in particular through the high-throughput omic technologies. Here biochemical networks of different levels of detail are modelled, starting with simple chemical reactions and signal transduction networks, up to individual cells and entire organisms. This increases the demand for efficient analysis methods. A Petri net is a mathematical modelling language for the description of concurrent behaviour of distributed systems. Its advantage is the ease of scalability of the models, which relates to the network's state space, as well as the structure of the network itself. In this work, we recall several stochastic simulation algorithms, e.g., exact as well as approximate methods. Furthermore, we introduce an approach to improve the efficiency of stochastic simulation for large and dense networks by a new approximate stochastic simulation algorithm called discrete-time leap method. We depict the wide range of simulative analyses of complex stochastic systems ranging from trace generation to the computation of transient solutions and steady state distributions. We set forth advanced analysis of stochastic models by means of simulative model checking. For the use of simulative model checking, we integrate the continuous stochastic (reward) logic (CS(R)L) and the probabilistic linear-time temporal logic with constraints (PLTLc). Simulative model checking has some limitations compared to the numerical methods, e.g., in principle it is possible to consider nested probabilistic formulas in CS(R)L, but not practical, since the calculation is not feasible in a reasonable period of time. In addition to the transient analysis, the steady state analysis is often of interest; therefore we have implemented two on-the-fly steady state detection methods. The first one is based on a ""sample batch means"" algorithm and is used in the linear-time temporal logic. The second approximates the steady state distribution and checks for convergence. We apply the aforementioned techniques to several case studies from systems biology and technical systems. The main contributions of this thesis to scientific knowledge are the development of the discrete-time leap method for the simulation of stochastic models, the approximations of transient solutions and steady state distributions by use of stochastic simulation for stochastic models and Markov reward models, the development of an infinite time horizon model checking algorithm exploiting the steady state property for PLTLc and CSL, and the first simulative model checking algorithm for CSRL incorporating state and impulse rewards. All presented algorithms and methods are implemented in the advanced analysis tool MARCIE.",,"Rohr, Christian",2016,,,OPUS4-4147,Dissertation
"Surface and interface characterization by X-ray and electron spectroscopies - revealing the peculiarities of Cu(In,Ga)Se&#8322; chalcopyrite and CH&#8323;NH&#8323;PbI(&#8323;-&#7530;)Cl&#7530; perovskite-based thin film solar cell structures",,"This thesis focuses on the investigation and characterization of the surfaces and interfaces of chalcopyrite-based Cu(In,Ga)Se&#8322; (CIGSe) and organo-metal mixed halide perovskites, specifically CH&#8323;NH&#8323;PbI(&#8323;-&#7530;)Cl&#7530; thin film solar cell absorbers using various x-ray and electron spectroscopies. In particular, the impact of alkali treatments on the chemical and electronic surface and near-surface structure of CIGSe absorbers is studied. For CH&#8323;NH&#8323;PbI(&#8323;-&#7530;)Cl&#7530; the compound formation is monitored and the peculiarities of the interface formation of CH&#8323;NH&#8323;PbI(&#8323;-&#7530;)Cl&#7530; on compact and mesoporous TiO&#8322; are examined. Laboratory and synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy are used to gain a depth-dependent picture of the chemical and electronic structure in the surface and near-surface region of CIGSe absorbers, focusing on the influence of NaF and NaF/KF post-deposition treatments (PDT) when compared to alkali-free CIGSe absorbers. The alkali-free and NaF-PDT absorbers show similar chemical properties, having a Cu and Ga poor surface region compared to the nominal bulk and the same chemical environment for indium and selenium. For the NaF/KF-PDT samples a K-In-Se compound is present on top of a Cu-In-Ga-Se compound, with a nanopatterned surface that is almost devoid of Cu and Ga. Further, for the NaF-PDT sample a near-surface electronic band gap of 1.61[+0.14/-0.51] eV is derived. In contrast, a large and more gradual change towards the surface is obtained for the NaF/KF-PDT absorber exhibiting a significant band gap widening of the surface, which is in agreement with a Cu- and Ga-devoid surface region and the formation of a K-In-Se surface compound. To in-situ monitor the compound formation of CH&#8323;NH&#8323;PbI(&#8323;-&#7530;)Cl&#7530; on compact TiO&#8322; (c-TiO&#8322;) hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used. During in-situ annealing a drop-casted layer of precursor solution on c-TiO&#8322; shifts in the perovskite related core levels can be observed upon reach the ""transition temperature"" of 80-100°C. Further the Cl signal decrease at the onset of annealing and shows a depletion in the surface region for annealing temperatures above 50°C. In addition, the chemical and electronic structure of the interface between perovskite and mesoporous TiO&#8322; (mp-TiO&#8322;) or c-TiO&#8322; using different perovskite layer thicknesses are studied.",,"Handick, Evelyn",2016,,,OPUS4-4243,Dissertation
Non-ohmic properties of highly resistive dust layers - experimental studies and numerical modelling under OpenFOAM®,,"Vortrag ""ICESP XIV. International Conference on Electrostatic Precipitation 2016"", Wroclaw, Polen, 19.-23.09.2016 Back corona and dust resistivity are well known topics in electrostatic precipitation. Back corona results from high dust resistivity and occurs when the field strength in the dust layer surpasses a critical value E crit, which is typically found to be in the order of 15 to 30 kV/cm. Besides the resistivity &#961;, the current density is the main parameter: E = i &#961; < E crit. Hence, possible actions against back corona include a reduction of &#961; by dust conditioning, or a reduction of i, for example by pulsed corona operation. Much work has been devoted to study the dependence of &#961; on dust composition, temperature, humidity, adsorption layers and dust layer porosity, and a variety of different set-ups for dust resistivity measurements has been proposed. Even though some authors report a dependence of &#961; on current density or field strength resp., dust resistivity is mostly seen as a material property. However, in measurements on product dusts in the upper resistivity range, we found that dusts show extremely non-ohmic properties: Most strikingly, resistivity may vary by several orders of magnitude with time. Also, the experimental arrangement can change the resistivity results by orders of magnitude: When resistivity is measured with the dust layer exposed to a corona discharge (imitating the situation in a real ESP), &#961; depends strongly on the layer thickness. Meanwhile the same dust does not show the strong layer thickness dependence when electrodes are placed on both sides of the dust layer, and also time effects are much less prominent. Additional findings include that dusts that have been exposed to resistivity measurements show a high level of electrostatic charging afterwards. An interpretation of these results may be found from the theory of semiconductors and electret materials. Accordingly, highly resistive dust layers do not contain mobile electrons. Current transport occurs only after charge carriers (free electrons or holes) have been injected from the electrodes or from a gas discharge adjacent to the surface. When the injection process is non-symmetric (e.g. with corona discharge), the current transport through the dust layer can be dominated by charge carriers of one polarity, depending on the polarity of the corona. Some of the effects observed in experiment, namely the layer thickness effect and the current density influence, can indeed be ascribed to unipolar injection and space charge limited conduction. The time effects can mainly be ascribed to the ""deep trapping"" of the charge carriers, leading to a high level of immobile space charge. As overall space charge is limited, this reduces the level of mobile space charge available for current transport. The space charge also leads to a deformation of the electric field inside the dust layer, and hence influences injection via the Schottky (thermionic field emission) mechanism. By integrating the mechanisms of charge transport in dielectrics (injection, drift, immobilization, recombination) into the OpenFOAM® simulation package, rather realistic simulations of time-dependent resistivity are possible. The simulations also are helpful to identify the mechanisms responsible for certain types of resistivity behavior.",,"Riebel, Ulrich; Aleksin, Yury; Vora, Alpesh Laxman",2016,,,OPUS4-4182,Konferenzveröffentlichung
A concept of renewable energy plant-storage capacity sizing for integration into electrical distribution network,,"Energy demand of continents, countries, communities and individuals will continue to increase in the phase of increasing population and improvement in the living standards of people. The attempt to meet this ever increasing demand and at the same time protect the environment has resulted in the fast growth of power generation from renewable sources of energy especially from wind through wind power plants and solar through photovoltaic power plants. This growth has been facilitated by various support schemes such as feed-in-tariff scheme, feed-in-premium and quota scheme. Further growth is expected in the future. This is because of the existing support schemes and the expectation of the emergence of improved technologies for harvesting renewable energy. This development of power generation from renewable sources of energy although positive lead to some distinctive negative effects on the existing electrical network to which they are connected. These negative effects are known and well documented. The fluctuating nature of wind and solar radiation at any given location over a given period of observation is seen to translate into the power they feed into the power network. This fluctuating infeed requires more active management of the network by system operators so as to ensure continuous reliable power generation and delivery. Sometimes the management process lead to non-utilization of power produced by the renewables sources. Secondly, expansion and reinforcement of some existing networks are needed in other to accommodate renewable power generators. These come at a cost. Many studies and researches have been dedicated to finding solutions to these issues. This work agrees with the use of storage systems as means of solving these issues but the question that remains unanswered is what the optimal way is. There is also a further push given to the view of installing renewable energy plants together with storage systems as a unit in this work. The main task presented in this work, however, is a concept of sizing renewable energy plant and storage systems as a unit. The resulting renewable energy plant-storage unit has the objective of supporting the electrical network to which it will be connected. Firstly the support should be by reducing the fluctuating effect from renewable production. Secondly by helping improve the load hosting capacity of the electrical network. This will be by supplying the part of the load demand leading to the reduction of the overall power drawn by connected loads from the electrical power network. Historic data of renewable resource and also the load demand at the point or bus of connection are the drivers of this concept. With the earlier mentioned objectives and random or stochastic nature of data involved, particle swarm optimization method is employed in implementing the concept of sizing to arrive at an optimal solution of required sizes of the renewable energy plant-storage system. The concept of sizing is based on proposing an ideal load demand that can be supplied by a utility under normal operating condition at all time. It follows that any extra demand should be supplied by the optimally sized renewable energy plant-storage unit. In this work sizing results of three scenarios presented. A single node network with three different types of the load was used in testing the effect of optimally sized renewable energy plant-storage system on an electrical network. The outcome of this test showed that the optimally sized renewable energy storage-system improved the ability of the test electrical network to support additional load hence load hosting capacity of test network was improved. The process required modelling and simulation all of which were carried out using MATLAB Simulink software.",,"Nanewortor, Xoese Kobla",2016,,,OPUS4-3943,Dissertation
